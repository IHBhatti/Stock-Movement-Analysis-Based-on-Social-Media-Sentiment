# Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-Sentiment
Description
This project demonstrates the process of data scraping, preprocessing, and predictive modeling to analyze stock movements based on sentiment analysis. The key steps include:

Scraping sentiment data.
Preprocessing and cleaning the text data.
Generating features for model training (e.g., sentiment scores).
Applying machine learning models for stock movement prediction.
Evaluating model performance using classification metrics.

# Dependencies
Required Libraries
The following Python libraries are needed to run the project:
Praw
pandas
datetime
re
sklearn (Scikit-learn)
imblearn (for SMOTE)
yfinance(for stock data downloading)
vadersentiment

# Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository: Download the project files to your local machine.
Download Necessary Data: Ensure you have the input data (reddit_stock_data) in the same directory as the notebook.
Run Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook and open the StockMovementFinalCode.ipynb.
Execute the Notebook: Follow the sequential steps in the notebook:
Data Scraping
Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Training and Evaluation
Model Results: Review the model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) printed at the end of the notebook.
