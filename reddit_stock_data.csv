"VKTX holder, Thoughts on Adding CRBP to Portfolio","Hi all! 

I started investing in 2022 and one of the first stocks I bought was VKTX for $3.18 a share. I’m not a big time investor by any means, but I figure as a grow my earnings I’ll reinvest and snowball this thing. 

I am now considering either buying a bit more VKTX at the current price of ~$50 or investing in a competing company - CRBP 

What are your thoughts in investing in a competing company? The industry is growing however they obviously don’t have the power behind them like Eli Lilly or AstraZeneca, so I have a little hesitation putting anymore eggs in this specific basket. ",1,1,1732119641.0

"Target shares plunge 20% after discounter cuts forecast, posts biggest earnings miss in two years","[Target](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/) on Wednesday missed Wall Street’s quarterly earnings and revenue expectations and posted only a slight uptick in customer traffic, despite the discounter’s price cuts on thousands of items and its early holiday sale. 

The big-box retailer reversed course and cut its full-year profit guidance, just three months after [hiking that forecast](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.htm). It said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.30 to $8.90. That’s [lower than the $9 to $9.70 per share range](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.html) that it shared in August and below the $9.55 a share expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Target now expects fourth-quarter comparable sales to be approximately flat. That metric, which is also known as same-store sales, includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months. 

Target fell short of Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate by 20%, its biggest miss in two years. It also marked its first revenue miss since August 2023.

The Secret to Compounding: Build Your War Chest & Financial Acumen Before Investing w/ Live Money,"***“The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves. But unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.”***  \-Warren Buffett

The quote is from the book, *The Tao of Warren Buffett*, by Mary Buffett. And if I would have read it ten years ago, it might have saved me from one of the biggest market screwups of my life, which turned an already bad situation into an all-out catastrophe, leaving me $70k in the hole and jobless. It’s a mistake I hope none of you have to learn the hard way, because it’s a bought lesson that would have been a lot easier to learn by reading, rather than spending the next three years trying to dig myself out of a self-inflicted financial dungeon.

The short version of the story was that I was losing my job at a coal-fired power plant and I believed the only thing that could save me was hitting a homer in the market. I bet big on a beaten down oil stock that it ended up going bankrupt. So, what went wrong? Even then, the answer was obvious. The oil market with in an all-out bull boom, which should have been a red flag to me. If the price of oil is going up, oil stocks shouldn’t be imploding! And no matter how bad I needed the “investment” to work, my 100% gamble was doomed to fail from the beginning. The market didn’t care about my employment status or the desperation of my financial position, and because I ignored the basic laws of gravity, the only thing I earned was a lesson so painful that I’ll never forget!

The same situation is happening again. I see a lot of folks on Reddit who desperately *need* an investment to work out, even though the odds are stacked against them. If you’re on this forum looking for the next “sure thing,” or some clever investment strategy that’s guaranteed to beat the market, stop. Take a deep breath. And READ! All it takes is one big screwup to blow up an account, which will then force you to get smarter just to even survive. Yes, hardship helped me find the right path and eventually propelled me to the Top 1% of 401k millionaires by age, but I could have gotten there a lot faster if I would have just saved, built a war chest week in and week out, then deployed it when the odds were strongly in my favor.

The magic number is $100k, and it’s the hardest. But once you hit this mark, you’ll then have all the utility you need to drastically compound returns and grow your accounts quickly.

But if you’re new to investing, right now, I’d encourage you to stay out of the market and learn before you go on a test drive live with money. But if you must buy something to satisfy your FOMO itch, buy a Russell 2000 index fund (median P/E is currently <12/very cheap) and save every dollar you can while you learn all the what-not-to-do fundamentals from books, not to mention the screwups of others—examples of which are in ample supply on Reddit. I can’t stress it enough: it’s so much easier to learn from the mistakes of others than to use your life savings to finance a financial education from the school of hard knocks.

I plan to keep blogging with a few pointers that have helped me through the years. I’m trying to make it a must-read resource for beginners and I’ve already got a few things there you might find helpful. You can find it at r/CountryDumb. One of those is a reading list I’ll repost here:

1.     **The Psychology of Speculation** (Henry Howard Harper)

3.     **Think and Grow Rich** (Napoleon Hill)

4.     **Outliers** (Malcom Gladwell)

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence. Given how deeply integrated global equity markets are, negative firm-specific or sector-specific surprises could easily spill-over across the borders.",20,0,1732095239.0

Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",11,6,1732057887.0
"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

ETSY turned things around and finally solved their issues. Better than Pinterest. ,"Etsy turned into shit for the last 2 years but they have turned things around. They have invested in and improved their mobile app massively. By showing bolder download prompts the result is +3M incremental app downloads. They reduced by 33% impressions of looking back (previous purchases) changed to looking for something new (inspiration and idea’s). Their app now feels and looks like a big Pinterest inspiration board with endless handmade and hand designed items.

***Etsy will repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of their common stock.***

They have spend the last Q3 on improving the search. Before the search results would be full of Aliexpress crap for about most of the feed. I’ve done research and searched on many niche and generic search terms. Most of the results were handmade and hand designed items. They have a \~40% reduction in search results where >25% of listings look a like.

I downloaded the app for my DD but i was scrolling for hours because it had good recommendations and inspiration for handmade items. It felt like using Pinterest before it got ridden with ads. Like browsing Tumblr before it got ruined.

Focus on gift giving gift recommendations per occasion and who you are shopping for. Investments into app development, marketing, expansion in the breath + sophistication of their data and integration of AI and GenAI.

**Position:** 52 shares in ETSY.  
**Next earnings:** 19 feb 2025.  
**Opinion:** Buy and hold, gift buying season is now, i expect next earnings to be good, buy shares for cheap.

***TLDR:*** *Etsy app was shit but they fixed it. They invested into app development and now the app is like scrolling Pinterest. Search problems are fixed and they focus on handmade gifts again.* *Etsy will repurchase up to an additional $1 billion of their common stock.*",17,18,1732045114.0

Self driving is coming to your favourite cars,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to dive into Mobileye (MBLY) and its role in the self-driving car industry, especially concerning partnerships with major automakers. Let's break it down.

Company Overview:

Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, specializes in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Their EyeQ® chips and software are integral to many vehicles' safety and automation features.

Key Partnerships:

Mobileye has secured collaborations with several major car manufacturers:

Volkswagen Group: In March 2024, Volkswagen announced a cooperation agreement with Mobileye to develop and supply software, hardware components, and digital maps for the self-driving ID. Buzz AD. 

Ford: Ford has integrated Mobileye's technology into its vehicles, enhancing their ADAS capabilities. 

Zeekr: The Chinese automaker Zeekr has collaborated with Mobileye to incorporate advanced driving technologies into its vehicles. 

Porsche: In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye announced a collaboration to introduce Mobileye's SuperVision™ automated driver-assist functions in future Porsche sports cars. 


Recent Developments:

In November 2024, Lyft announced partnerships with Mobileye and other companies to integrate self-driving cars into its ride-hailing service. This collaboration aims to advance autonomous vehicle research and development, with plans to launch self-driving taxis in Atlanta next year. 

Financial Performance:

Mobileye's stock has experienced fluctuations. As of November 8, 2024, the stock price was $16.42. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some expressing concerns over growth prospects and competition. 

Future Outlook:

Mobileye's extensive partnerships position it as a significant player in the autonomous driving sector. However, the industry faces challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technological advancements, and competition from other tech companies and automakers developing in-house solutions.

Investment Considerations:

Investors should monitor Mobileye's ability to maintain and expand its partnerships, adapt to technological changes, and navigate the competitive landscape. The company's success in these areas will be crucial for its growth and profitability in the evolving autonomous vehicle market.

What are your thoughts on Mobileye's prospects in the self-driving car industry? Let's discuss!

" UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles. Would love to hear everybody's thoughts. (I own no position in UBER but am actively looking to start one soon at these prices)",32,52,1732038238.0
"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

"Exciting times for space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks!","Space, nuclear and quantum computing stocks are ripping and roaring. There are lot of small to mid cap companies in these industries that could one day be mega cap companies - picking the correct ones is the hard part. 

Would love to hear everyone’s favorite companies in these three sectors, supported by a little explanation as to why you think they have a bright future. 

I am particularly excited about these three industries because I believe the number of satellites in orbit will grow significantly in the next 10 years. I am optimistic that SMR nuclear reactors are going to become mainstream in the coming years. And I believe quantum computing is finally here, and real world applications are popping up every day. 

My personal picks for these three categories are RDW, OKLO and IONQ. Let me know if you agree with these picks or think there are better options. I have a small stake in all three.

What your take on FMNA/FMCC?,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it’s a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally. 

Today’s sentiment by the trump administration is to release them from conservatorship. It could be a 20-50x pps jump next year. ",11,8,1732023844.0

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

S&P 500 Rebalancing Trade,"The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.



S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.



Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable.



Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):

Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.
   * Presented encouraging data in advanced TNBC, EGFR-mutated NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma at ESMO 2024.

To raise a question, I have little expertise in biology myself and I deem the company's ability to bring new products to market successfully will be a critical factor in its future performance. Given the inherent risks in drug development and the transition away from COVID-19 vaccine revenues, I want to ask if there are any actual experts on reddit that can provide me with som insights as to how impactful are the company's new drugs as well as the potencial for success. This will heavily influence my decision for investment, thanks in advance. Other thoughts are also open and welcomed!",11,18,1731944536.0

Tax Loss Harvesting,"Question regarding hedging with tax loss harvesting. What are the pros and cons of this strategy? What am I missing?

If it drops 6% and I sell, causing a $3k loss, I get to write that off on my taxes. Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation.

MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI. I’m expecting an announcement in the next month on who the new logo is and I think it’s pretty likely the largest name in the industry!",20,3,1731942329.0

Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",274,67,1731903761.0

My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

Note: This analysis is based on publicly available information and market conditions as of the report date. Please conduct your own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Don't blame me if you end up losing money on this ABNB short :)",73,29,1731887692.0

"New Nvidia AI chips overheating in servers, the Information reports","Nov 17 (Reuters) - Nvidia's new Blackwell AI Chips, which have already faced delays, have encountered problems with accompanying servers that overheat, causing some customers to worry they will not have enough time to get new data centers up and running, the Information reported on Sunday.The Blackwell graphics processing units overheat when connected together in server racks designed to hold up to 72 chips, the report said, citing sources familiar with the issue.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump) has selected Chris Wright, a campaign donor and fossil fuel executive, to serve as energy secretary in his upcoming, second administration.

>CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of [oil and gas development](https://apnews.com/hub/oil-and-gas-industry), including fracking, a key pillar of Trump’s quest to achieve U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market.

>Wright has been one of the industry’s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end [a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals](https://apnews.com/article/lng-exports-biden-europe-climate-russia-3c2bfd853c0d53531a677b142b009dbc) by the Biden administration.

>Wright also has criticized what he calls a “top-down” approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is “collapsing under its own weight.” Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty.

>Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.

>Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump’s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to [donate $1 billion to Trump’s campaign](https://apnews.com/article/schumer-democrats-big-oil-price-fixing-collusion-07a8583a2b12e645d2860608c626cc7c), with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.

>Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright’s experience in the energy sector “gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership"" of the Energy Department.

>“We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE’s pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world,"" Sommers said.

>Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright “a champion of dirty fossil fuels"" and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was “a disastrous mistake.”

>“The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,"" Wong said. “Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE’s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.""

Lets talk pharma stocks,"If your not aware the entire sector has been selling off on the appointment of RFK jr for secretary of Health and Human services. Although he was nominated he still has to get approved by the senate, and the senate has big pharma supporting them. So whether he actually gets the position is to be determined.

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy. People need to understand drugs and vaccines are a global business not just the US. Europe, South America and Asia have their own FDA and approve US drugs and vaccines.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too.

BKNG and negative shareholder equity.,"Ive been searching for a new stock to buy recently and was considering an online travel stock like BKNG or TCOM. A little wary of TCOM as its China based. BKNG income statement doesnt look bad but i was looking through BKNG's balance sheet and realised they somehow have an enormous amount of debt and negative shareholder equity.

PENN - Anybody seeing this? Weekly crossed the 50-Day for first time in 3 years...,"The 8- and 21-day MA's just crossed over the 50-day on the weekly chart for the first time since 2021. This seems like a significant milestone for a stock that has been beaten down since it's failure with Barstool during the meme-stock craze.

You can see my other posts for a more in-depth thesis, but some recent news worth mentioning plus a conspiracy theory:

* Stock is up 30% in the past 6 months, yet \~15% short interest of float. 
* Q3 EPS beat, Rev didn't. Lower promo expenses. Lower losses in OSB than expected. Market share not where we want, but path to profitability is improving.
* Former Disney CTO joined the company. As a reminder, Disney owns ESPN so I see this as more buy-in from the Disney team. 
* Greenlight Capital increased their stake, it is now their 6th largest holding. Einhorn said ""we believe the market ascribes a substantial negative value to \[their OSB business\]"". And thinks OSB could add $20 per share of value.
* ESPN --- ESPN Bet account linking allows the app to know your favorite sports and fantasy team so it can create personalized bets/marketing for users. Shows further integration with Disney.
* Finally launched in NYC, mixed results for now. 
* Multiple analysts initiate coverage, showing it is a player worth tracking. Mixed opinions.

One big deal that no one talks about here is that Disney currently has $500M in warrants to purchase PENN stock. If I remember correctly, their agreement was for 3 years; if Disney doesn't like ESPN Bet's performance then they can pull the plug. Well we just crossed Year 1 and Disney's CTO has now joined PENN, they're linking ESPN accounts, they're seeing fewer losses than expected, and by 2026 (year 3) PENN believes they will have ""meaningful free cash flow"" from OSB. I have a very hard time believing that Disney would rather go through the headache of ripping out all of their integrations with PENN to find a new provider. Like the sunk cost there would be massive and why would they? The just want a faceless tech/casino provider so that they can put their own brand as the name. Fanduel/DraftKings/MGM, all of those would want their own names on the app. 

Additionally, and maybe this really gets to the tinfoil hat (I don't think it's as crazy as you might), why wouldn't Disney acquire more PENN stock? It's one of the cheapest casino operators out there right now, sports betting is becoming more mainstream (and palatable for DIS investors), and they get more upside if this thing takes off? The market for OSB continues to grow as more states legalize it and they have a massive opportunity to gain market share. Why wouldn't they want more of that upside?

Look, I've been DCA-ing into PENN over the past year, so do I want this to be right? Absolutely. But there just seem to be way too many tailwinds popping up for this valuation to make any sense with even a remotely successful ESPN Bet. DraftKings has been significantly more unprofitable ever since launching their app in 2018 and trades at 5.0x their Rev, but when PENN is negative it trades at 0.5x (other valuation methods show similar)?

Yeah I don't see that lasting, so I'll buy more. Would love to hear your thoughts.",30,4,1731720151.0

Can someone help me with my evaluation of a stock? ,"I never post, so i don't know how to refer to a thread, but i posted this in r/investing_discussion but without any succes.

So i have been trying to calculate companies i find interesting by dividing Total assets by Free Cash Flow. When i do this for the average company within the S&P500 i get insane values. Take PayPal for example. With a Total asset value of $82 Billion and divide it by $4.2 Billion in free cash flow = 19,5 years before you as the company owner earned it all back. that is close enough to the historical average, not too shabby.

However, when i do this for Wise PLC, i take $15,1 billion in total assets and divide it by $3,2 billion free cash Flow = 4,7 years...

Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Why is Buffet buying Domino's DPZ with -$112 book value?,"Just curious if anyone has insight, maybe an accounting background.  If you have read much about Warren Buffet you know other than his wealth, his claim to fame is value investing and his company's namesake, Berkshire Hathaway all started with a takeover of a company he found that was being traded at a significant discount to book value.

So I have to ask, how is he evaluating stocks now?  I saw that they took a decent stake in DPZ and look up the financials and note the company was trading for $430 per share with a book value of -$112 per share.  Obviously, not a lot of attention is paid to Book value these days by most investors, but this is one of the largest discrepancies I've ever seen between market price and book value.  So I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on why he would ignore those figures?  I know it's a strong business still I'm curious why Buffet would not be scared away by the discrepancy if he's a value investor.",303,191,1731662511.0
Naive question: Intel 18A--what could go wrong?,"\[Disclosure: not invested in Intel yet but thinking about doing so\]

Ok, we know Intel messed up and whatever but what I do not get (so please challenge my train of thoughts):

* Intel got newest machines from ASML last year
* They use them for 18A
* Like TSMC does for AMD, Apple, etc.
* Lunar Lake is a combo of Intel's design skills and TSMC's/ASML's fab skills
* But with low margins because of latter
* However, Lunar Lake turned out pretty good, so Intel's design skills are def there
* And with 18A, Intel will have everything in-house

So, what could go wrong? Maybe Intel need quite some time to catch up and have the same fab capacity based on ASML machines but we will get there at some point.

The competition? AMD will have (long-term!) lower margins b/c of TSMC (also slower time-to-market, lower quantities), Qualcomm has lower compat and needs still to resort issues with ARM, Nvidia while capable will need some time and will have a good offer but they won't have a fab either and will face compat issues like Qualcomm. Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...

What does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years

Edit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par

Edit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?

Edit3: typos

So, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really ""dirt-cheap""?",10,47,1731659549.0

Deep dive into Cal-Maine - Cracking the shell: The complex World of Eggs,"**1.0 Introduction**

Every once in a while, I stumble upon a company that seems simple, yet, turns out to be incredibly complex. Cal-Maine is one that fits this description.

It is the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. (market share of \~14.5%), and its closest competitor is almost half its size.

Based on the description, one would expect that this is a relatively simple company. I mean, **it only sells eggs, right?**

What if I told you that the management has very little control over a business of this kind? There’s a lot to unpack, so let’s get started.

  
**2.0 The eggs**

In theory, the revenue generated would be equal to the **number of eggs sold** multiplied by the **average egg price**. So let’s have a look at these two variables:

Cal-Maine sells two types of eggs:

* **Specialty** \- These encompass a broad range of products, such as cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs.
* **Conventional** \- all other shell eggs

Why is this important? The specialty eggs are typically sold at prices and terms negotiated directly with customers. Unlike conventional, where the wholesale prices are volatile.

In 2024, the company sold 12% more dozens than back in 2018. This is more impressive than it sounds, as this is not a growing market. The demand for eggs is relatively stable, in fact, and it only grows with an increase in population. This indicates the company has slightly increased its market share during this time. To illustrate how stable the sales were in terms of volume, the 12% increase from 2018 to 2024 came without any down year.

But more importantly, the composition has changed. In 2018, about 244m dozens of specialty eggs were sold. This number increased to 401m in 2024 (**+64%**)! The % of specialty eggs of the total eggs sold increased from 24% to 35%.

Here are the prices from 2018 to 2024:

Conventional: $1.23 --> $1.04 --> $0.98 --> $0.98 --> $1.42 --> $2.73 --> $1.73

Specialty: $1.92 --> $1.93 --> $1.88 --> $1.88 --> $1.93 --> $2.40 --> 2.31

The specialty eggs are not only more expensive, but the price is significantly more stable.  Well, except for 2023. What was that about? Why were conventional eggs more expensive?

The answer is **HPAI**, known as “**Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza**” which is deadly to domestic poultry and can wipe out entire flocks within a matter of days. When there is an HPAI outbreak, there is a significant decrease in supply, which pushes the price up. This is unpredictable, and the only way to deal with this is to mitigate the risk by having multiple locations, something that Cal-Maine has.

  
The volatility of egg prices ***(per dozen)*** is significant, so despite the volume of dozens sold being stable, it is impossible to forecast the revenue of the company over time, given the volatility of the prices. But this is just the start.



**3.0 The direct costs**

The largest direct cost relates to feed. The vast majority of the corn and soybeans are purchased from suppliers in the U.S. and there is quite some volatility.

**So the management isn’t in control of the costs, nor the revenue.** That is a tough position to be in.

This is exactly why the financials are all over the place, despite the stable sales from a volume point of view.

Over the last decade:

\- The gross margin has fluctuated between **12% and 38%.**

\- The operating margin has fluctuated between **-2% and 31%.**

  
**4.0 Now what?**

So, what can the management do? Not much, other than being prepared for a bad year, as it is only a matter of time before that happens.

For that reason, the company has **no debt**.

In addition, its dividend policy is defined in relation to its profitability. The quarterly dividend payout is 1/3rd of its quarterly net income. This is definitely reasonable. Where does the remaining cash go to?

* **Acquisitions** \- There have been a total of 24 acquisitions, ranging from 160,000 to 7.5m layers.
* **Investment securities** \- Mostly U.S. Government and agency obligations, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.

I do think that the management does a good job, but the uncertainty scares away many investors.

  
**5.0 Other important topics**

**5.1 Walmart**

About 89% of the total revenue relates to sales to retail customers and 11% to food service providers.

**Walmart (including Sam’s Club)** is a major customer, accounting for 34% of its revenue. Although this might be perceived as a risk by many, I’d argue that is one of the biggest strengths the company has. Walmart has no alternative, as no competitor can quickly jump in to replace Cal-Maine.

**5.2 The special shares**

The company has two types of shares:

* **Common** (trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol $CALM- 44.2m shares outstanding
* **Class A** \- 4.8m shares outstanding, owned by an LLC

So, why are there two types of shares? Although both of them have the same rights in terms of dividends and liquidation, each class A shares is entitled to **10 votes.**

This means the class A shareholders have **52% voting rights.**

**6.0 Valuation**

So, how does one value a company of this kind when not only there are many pieces of the puzzle, but the pieces are changing?

Does a DCF make sense? Not really. There is no point attempting to forecast the next 5 or 10 years, when the next 2 are uncertain.

I’d argue that this is a company that could be treated like a bond, where the coupon is fluctuating, and a dividend discount model would be an appropriate way to value it. Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use FCF - SBC.

  
So, how to estimate the FCF? There will always be good and bad years in a company of this kind. So using the average of the last decade would be a good place to start.

  
FCF - SBC: $180m

Growth in perpetuity: 8%

Discount rate: 9%

Value of the business: $3 billion

\+ Cash: $182m

\+ Non-operating assets: $539m

\- Value of equity options: $12

**Value of the company: $3.7 billion ($76/share)**

This is slightly lower than the current market cap of **$4.6 billion ($91/share)**.



So, anyone who is betting on Cal-Maine is ultimately betting that:

1. The egg market will remain stable, from a volume point of view - **which is very likely**
2. The future prices (eggs, corn, soybeans) will be slightly more favorable on average than the past prices - **which is uncertain**
3. Walmart will remain a key customer - **which is likely**
4. There will be no significant HPAI outbreak that will harm Cal-Maine - **which is uncertain**
5. The class A shareholders votes will be in the interest of all shareholders - given the past decisions, **this is likely**
6. The management will continue to run the company safely, without any significant debt position - **which is likely**

Based on the list above, there are two uncertainties, prices and HPAI outbreaks. Quite a lot to digest, for such a “simple” business. It’s only eggs, right?

I hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.

Is HIMS still Buy after Amazon competition concerns?,"[Amazon's push into telehealth knocks shares of Hims & Hers | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/amazons-push-into-telehealth-knocks-shares-hims-hers-2024-11-14/)

  
Amazon announced it was entering the hair loss and erectile dysfunction treatment markets through its newly expanded pay-per-visit telehealth service, Amazon One Medical.

HIMS generates 80%+ gross margins from its core hair loss/ED markets and the substantial operating leverage observed to date is directly from its ability to source drugs cheaply and sell them at nice mark-ups to more patients,

  
Amazon will charge $16 a month for the generic hair-loss pill finasteride. Hims advertises a $22-a-month price for the same medicine.

Boeing starts issuing layoff notices as planemaker trims 10% of workforce,"Boeing said on Wednesday it is issuing layoff notices starting this week to workers impacted by a broader plan by the heavily indebted planemaker to cut 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its global workforce.

U.S. staff receiving the notices this week will stay on Boeing's payroll until January to comply with federal requirements that give workers 60 days' notice prior to ending their employment. News that Boeing would send out the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) in mid-November was widely expected.

“As previously announced, we are adjusting our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and a more focused set of priorities,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We are committed to ensuring our employees have support during this challenging time.""

The notices come as Boeing under new CEO Kelly Ortberg is trying to revive production of its strongest-selling 737 MAX, after a crippling weeks-long strike by more than 33,000 U.S. West Coast workers halted output of most of its commercial jets.

"Intuitive Machines (LUNR) reports third quarter 2024 results, up 359% YOY, improved profitability with $4.1 million","HOUSTON, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Intuitive Machines, Inc. (Nasdaq: LUNR, “Intuitive Machines,” or the “Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, “Intuitive Machines had a very strong third quarter highlighted by key wins, revenue growth, and the largest cash balance in Company history. Throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on our three core service pillars: delivery, data transmission, and infrastructure as services. These pillars provide foundational capabilities that enable the missions and goals of commercial and government exploration of the Moon.”

Q3 Highlights


Awarded $116.9 million contract through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, marking Intuitive Machines’ fourth contract award, more than any other CLPS vendor


Sole awardee of Near Space Network (NSN) data services contract from NASA with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion, a transformative step for Intuitive Machines in data transmission for in-space communications and navigation


Completed vehicle propulsion system hot fire for Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission, representing the most complex integrated test of the vehicle, in preparation for a Q1 launch from the Kennedy Space Center


Achieved $58.5 million of revenue in Q3, up 359% YoY; $173.3 million year to date, more than double all of 2023


Improved profitability with $4.1 million of positive gross margin in Q3


Ended Q3 with $89.6 million in cash, the highest quarter ending cash balance in Company history


Reported record backlog of $316.2 million, the highest quarter ending backlog in Company history driven primarily by Intuitive Machines’ fourth NASA CLPS award; backlog does not yet include the full $150 million of initial task orders for Near Space Network data services


Mr. Altemus continued, “We made progress across all three pillars by first securing another south pole lunar delivery mission, then winning the Near Space Network Services contract, and finally, continuing to mature both our LTV design in conjunction with our heavy cargo class lander. These strategic revenue streams bring our business thesis clearly into view, allowing us to focus on capturing more operational services, which we believe will provide long-tail revenues with higher margins.”

Intuitive Machines CFO Pete McGrath said, “As demonstrated in the quarter, we continue to execute on current programs while winning key awards. I look forward to guiding the Company through a new lens as CFO and focus on managing costs efficiently to drive towards profitability and achieve our financial targets.”

Disney narrowly beats estimates as streaming boosts entertainment segment,"Disney reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, narrowly beating analyst estimates as streaming growth helped propel its entertainment segment. 

Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG

Earnings per share: $1.14 adjusted vs. $1.10 expected

Revenue: $22.57 billion vs. $22.45 billion expected

Disney’s net income increased to $460 million, or 25 cents per share, from $264 million, or 14 cents per share, during the same quarter last year. Adjusting for one-time items, including restructuring and impairment charges, Disney reported earnings per share of $1.14. 

Total segment operating income increased 23% to $3.66 billion compared with the same period in 2023.  

Revenue for the entertainment segment – which includes the traditional TV networks,  direct-to-consumer streaming and films – increased 14% year over year to $10.83 billion after a hot summer at the box office.

Disney Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time this summer, surpassing Disney’s “Frozen II” at the box office. Meanwhile, its “Deadpool & Wolverine” became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, surpassing Warner Bros. Discovery’s “Joker.”

The films added $316 million of profit for the entertainment segment during the quarter. Overall, the entertainment segment reported nearly $1.1 billion in profit.

Revenue for Disney’s sports segment, made up primarily of ESPN, was flat. ESPN’s profit fell 6% due in part to higher programming costs associated with U.S. college football rights as well as fewer customers in the cable bundle. 

Disney’s combined streaming business, which includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, saw profitability improve during the quarter after turning its first profit during the fiscal third quarter, three months earlier than expected. The division reported an operating income of $321 million for the September period compared with a loss of $387 million during the same period last year. 

Disney joined its peers, including Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast and Paramount Global in adding streaming subscribers during the most recent quarter. 

Disney+ Core subscribers – which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region – grew by 4.4 million, or 4%, to 122.7 million. Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 52 million. 

Average revenue per user for domestic Disney+ customers dropped from $7.74 to $7.70, as the company had a higher mix of customers on its cheaper, ad-supported tier and wholesale offerings. 

Meanwhile the company’s traditional TV networks business continued to decline as consumers leave pay TV bundles behind in favor of streaming. Revenue for the networks was down 6% to $2.46 billion. Profit for the segment sank 38% to $498 million. 

The experiences segment, which includes Disney’s theme parks as well as consumer products, saw revenue grow 1% to $8.24 billion. 

The domestic parks’ operating income rose 5% to $847 million, helped by higher guest spending at the parks and cruise lines. 

Operating income at the international parks, however, fell 32% due to a decline in attendance and in guest spending as well as increased costs. 

The company said Thursday it’s “confident in the long-term prospects for the business,” and provided an outlook that includes its fiscal 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Disney expects a “modest decline” in Disney+ Core subscribers during the fiscal first quarter of 2025 compared with the prior quarter.

Full-year profit in the entertainment streaming business, which excludes ESPN+, is expected to see an increase of roughly $875 million compared to the prior fiscal year and to increase by a double digit percentage in its fiscal 2026.

Disney also anticipates double-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 for its entertainment segment.

The experience segment, however, is expected to see just 6% to 8% profit growth in the coming fiscal year compared to the prior year. Disney noted the fiscal first quarter will see a $130 million hit due to the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, as well as a $90 million impact from Disney Cruise Line pre-launch costs.

During Disney’s fiscal 2025, the company expects high-single digit adjusted earnings growth compared to the prior fiscal year. The company expects double digit adjusted EPS growth in both fiscal 2026 and 2027.

Distribution of your assets between cash/stocks while the market is overvalued?,"It’s pretty clear that the market has hit insane valuations, and has already been discussed to death. My question is: have you all started to trim your stock positions for more cash to hedge risk of a market downturn, or will you continue to stay at the previous distribution you had prior to this years rally? For example, if you were 70% stock 30% cash/bonds prior to the bull market, have you adjusted your ratios in response to the current valuation (ex to 40% stock 60% cash) or stick with 70%/30%?

My personal strategy was extremely aggressive during the previous bear market (100% of my networth minus 10k for emergencies was in QQQ). I started trimming this after the valuations got higher and I am sitting around 70% stocks/30% cash currently. I am intending to push this to 50% stocks if the market rallies more",0,68,1731564328.0

From what I know is that if I sold at a lost and rebrought within the 30 day of the same stock that it will be added to the new share cost basis. 

Now I've currently have sold all of my postion and do not forsee buying back in the rest of the year. My broker Fidelity automatically adjusted the new cost basis for the wash sales. From my understanding as long as I keep it that way I can realized the loss of the adjust basis.

Why do shareholders of a company with positive shareholder equity still receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy?,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently looking at the situation with Spirit Airlines. I’m not a shareholder, but I was interested in the fact that they report about $807m in shareholder equity.

Spirit now claim that the bonds due in 2025 and 2026 are a problem, and they must renegotiate, likely resulting in a wipeout of shareholders and Chapter 11.

My question is, if the company has equity value remaining, why do the shareholders end up with nothing? Is it because the value of those assets would likely not stack up to the value of liabilities when liquidated/sold off (although I would assume depreciation accounts for that)? Or is it because the costs incurred during the bankruptcy process would exceed the shareholder equity in the company?

I can’t imagine the process would cost them $807m…

"Robotics, Cyber-Security, Beverage and Industrial Stocks ","I wanted to buy some individual stocks today from 4 different industries. After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me. 

Would love to hear your opinions on the stocks, and would like to know if you have better options in these 4 industries. I opened a small position today in these 4 stocks. ",71,32,1731539826.0
Cisco reports fourth straight quarter of declining revenue,"Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected

Cisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

Networking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Security revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.

Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.

“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.

U.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.

During the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.

Cisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.

As of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.

"AMD to lay off 4% of workforce, or about 1,000 employees","AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.

*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”

AMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

AMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.

AMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

AMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.

GPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

AMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.

PG&E to deploy nuclear-specific AI at Diablo Canyon plant ,"Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.

Atomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.

Federal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.

“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”

The Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.

As California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.

"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works","There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

Liberty Live will hold roughly 69.9 million shares of Live Nation Entertainment, sports experiences provider Quint and certain other assets, according to a release.

In September, Liberty Broadband went public with its aspirations to merge with Charter, in a move to simplify Malone’s portfolio. Liberty owns 26% of Charter shares. The Liberty Media and Liberty Live split is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025, and the sale of Liberty Broadband to Charter is expected to be completed in mid-2027. “The split-off of Liberty Live Group into a separate public entity will simplify Liberty Media’s capital structure, should reduce the discount to net asset value of our Liberty Live stock and enhance trading liquidity at both entities,” Maffei said in a release.

>Following today’s announcements at Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband, all the Liberty acquisitions completed during my tenure are now in structures where shareholders can have more direct ownership in their upside,” Maffei said in a separate release. “While it’s never easy to leave an organization as dynamic as Liberty, I am confident that this is the right time.” Maffei has been part of Liberty since 2005 and has various positions on boards of the company’s assets, including Charter. Malone is a pioneer of the cable industry, long known as the “cable cowboy,” and has kept his hand in various media assets over the years. He’s been an independent director of Warner Bros. Discovery — initially through Discovery, before the company merged with Warner Bros., under his advisement.

Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

However, in cases like American Airlines or Hertz they were able to keep equity for shareholders. I know these two examples are a bit different in that Hertz was able to raise money fast and AA was able to do a merger.

(AHR) I’m back as promised; +44% since first post; senior living healthcare REIT sector outperforming; earnings release once again beat est.,"My first two posts: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/4OEM4c1Bq9

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/s/bKcUEjlglR

All in all with the rise and fall of recession fears and the hovering election reactions - to cover the catalysts as of previous:

Federal rate cuts and lessening borrowing fees, growing average senior age, dwindling rates of new construction resulting in higher occupancy rates, and greater focus on specialized senior healthcare. 

For American Healthcare REIT - Currently the peak was +44% from initial post - with earnings from today beating wall street analyst EPS by 12.5% and beating YoY growth in 3/4 asset incomes. With debt, asset evaluations and growth rate as a rough value estimate, I believe it’s nearing the $30 fair value since it’s IPO earlier this year after they have purchased the final 24% minority stake of Trilogy Healthcare which has generated the majority of revenue from the company. They’ve done a stand up job making focuses on specialized care for senior homes and removing the outpatient medical properties, selling them off as they’ve been underperforming as of recent. I expect more reports of increased occupancy rates nearing 90% which would be pre-Covid levels. 

For the healthcare REIT sector - over the past year with recovery from COVID effects - the healthcare REIT stock sector has outperformed the US market by 22.7%, and the real estate sector in general by 65.8%. With the constantly increased forward guidance every quarter for AHR  and associated senior living REITs and the narrowing rate of new constructions that aren’t set to appear in bulk in the industry at least for a year or so - I expect the atmosphere to be relatively competitive.

The sector i believe will stay strong in the long run but especially right now during times of expensive new constructions costs, while dwindling interest rates (for now) will most likely give way to these companies projecting new asset properties to expand their revenue streams, the landscape is tight while the populace of seniors continues to grow by the day.

Tejon Ranch could be the new st Joe or Howard Hughes,"$TRC - Tejon Ranch Co - 450m mkt cap

Tejon is one of the largest land holding companies in the US, owning 270,000 acres (1,093 km2) in California. its owns the tejon commerce center and is planning 3 new master planned comunities.

Stock has been crap over the last 10,20,30 years and board was very poor, horrible capital allocation and disproportionate salaries.

Can’t understate how important last week could be for Tejon as it starts its journey of improving shareholder relationships and path to unlocking value.

Up to now TRC’s board was like a cemetary (no offense) 

average age of the board was above 80 and most people had been with the company for over 20 years..

Volkswagen raises Rivian stake by 16% to $5.8 billion,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-volkswagen-group-launch-5-211929826.html

(Reuters) -Volkswagen Group raised its investment in Rivian by 16% to $5.8 billion and the two companies said on Tuesday they were launching their previously announced joint venture to develop electric vehicle architecture and software.

The companies said in June that VW would invest $5 billion in Rivian. Shares in the U.S. EV maker rose nearly 4% in extended trading.

The joint venture aims to integrate advanced electrical infrastructure and Rivian's software technology for future EVs of both companies, across all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars, the firms said.

Volkswagen plans to invest the $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027, including an initial $1 billion convertible note.

The Audi-parent will also invest $1.3 billion for intellectual property licenses and an equity stake and up to $3.5 billion in future equity, notes and debt, all tied to specific milestones.

Rivian's Chief Software Officer Wassym Bensaid and VW Group's Chief Technical Engineer Carsten Helbing will lead the joint venture named Rivian and VW Group Technology LLC.

Developers and engineers in the JV will be based initially in Palo Alto, California with three additional sites under development.

The joint venture will use Rivian's existing tech to launch Rivian's R2 in the first half of 2026 and potentially debut Volkswagen Group models as early as 2027.",487,74,1731448898.0

I'm aware that its just gambling and I've accepted the potential of losing all $800 i just wanna get some trading  experience have a little fun and maybe learn some stuff

First thing I did was buy some MCD during the Ecoli thing and sold it when it went back up (made $10) then I found this company Tetra Tech (TTEK) and bought 8 shares at $46. I did this because I saw they recently won a 12 billion contract with DLA as well as a couple other multi million dollar gov contracts. 

  
Price has gone up a little its only been a week or less but I'm confused am I totally misreading how stocks work. I would assume when a company starts making a ton of money the stock goes up. 

Obviously they havent earned that 12 billion yet but are these contracts not as concrete as they seem? Am I thinking stupidly about this? 

Another red flag is that in the last year it looks like the CEO and CFO have sold millions worth of shares.

Any advice would be much appreciated!",6,7,1731435106.0
"Deep dive into eBay - The Rise, The decline and The Reality Check","**1.0 Introduction**

eBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.

In 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.

The most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.

The auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.



**2.0 Competition**

eBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.

Its competition comes in different forms:

* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.
* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.
* **Etsy** \- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.

eBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.

  
**3.0 Its business model**

eBay’s revenue comes in many forms:

* Final value fees
* Listing fees
* Feature fees
* Store subscription fees
* Sale of advertisements
* Revenue sharing arrangements
* Shipping fees, etc.

Ultimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\~85%) and advertising (\~15%).



**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**

In companies of this kind, two important metrics are:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.

Let’s have a look at both of them.

The GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their ""take-rate"" in 2022.

It used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.

So, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.



**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

Although its revenue is flat (\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. 

Behind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.



|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|
|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\-17%|
|China|$856|$1.124|31%|
|Germany|$1.249|$967|\-23%|
|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|
|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\-1%|

UK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.

This could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.



**5.0 Capital allocation**

A huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.

Since 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:

* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.
* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).

  
This led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.

One notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.

  
**6.0 Valuation**

This is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

The key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**

Based on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.

Similarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:



|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|
|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|
|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|



If the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.

Disney - what am I getting for $100?,"Starting a new conversation on DIS, as the last one is almost 3 month old. My tone will be neutral, because I'm just contemplating my decision about DIS stock. Don't know Long or Short?

So, what does $100 buy me:

* Disney+ streaming service with 130M subscribers. That's half of NFLX. You do the math. Punish Disney for ""meh"" content quality in comparison to NFLX, but then, not everyone needs *edge of chair, nail biting* content. Think about boomers who just want to look at a glowing TV screen with drama soaps on.
* Top notch studios like Marvel, Pixar, 20th century, ABC. Sports network of ESPN.
* Theme parks in US, Paris, China, Tokyo. Cruise line (probably a cash burner).
* New CEO in early 2026, meaning.. plenty of time for Iger to look for a new job, leverage, armtwist whatever he has in mind.
* PE of 38 against 12 of Comcast.

Anyone else getting nervous about an impending recession?,"Prices feel inflated.  Tomorrow's prices are priced in today and as that continues every day at some point that logic ceases to be ""investing"" but rather ""speculation"" and thats the key-word behind every bubble.

If you've listened/read anything from the most successful investors, all the red flags they bring up are being seen now.   When EVERYONE is so optimistic is now whats making me most nervous.  If you read about major crashes and recessions of the past, they are always precipitated with quotes from investors about how if you're not in the market you're losing out and everythings looking great, future is great,

Tariffs will be inflationary.  Tax cuts will disproportionately favor big businesses.  Interest rates are going down because the fed is reactionary. All of these have the recipe for inflation to increase again but this time squeezing americans to the point where buying stops.  It will also induce a panic in the market that might trigger a large correction.   Trump wants to increase local production which will help in the short-run, but his foreign policy is unpredictable so hard to say what oil imports will do.

I think most people have some cautious optimism, but at what point does it become more caution than optimism?

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.

The company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”

Netflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.

Recently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.

Beginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

When Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.

Netflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.

Netflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.

Media companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.

Netflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.

Netflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.

"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

For TSLA is next options move ,"Last Friday's surge was clearly the result of an options Gamma Squeeze, in which a large number of people purchased call options, forcing the options market maker to buy shares, pushing the stock price further up, and then more people bought call options, and the options market maker was forced to buy more shares, and the process repeats itself!

Gamma Squeeze can make the stock price surge quickly in a short period of time, but this kind of increase is often unsustainable, because options market makers to buy a large number of shares, due to the stock price in a very high position, holding the risk is quite large, the options market makers will be the IV of the call options continue to raise, so that the operation of buying the call options become less lucrative

At this time, once someone sells a call option, the options market maker will sell shares to hedge, the stock price in a short period of time, the biggest buying momentum will disappear, the compression effect is lost, the stock price will turn down, a large number of profitable call options will also be closed, which in turn will lead to options market maker to sell more positive shares

For the next half month, we may try to move up and down first this week, but then I think TSLA is about to have a pullback close to 15%~20% or so.

Of course, these ups and downs due to the Gamma Squeeze won't change a company's long-term fundamentals, and with a share price below $300 TSLA is certainly a position to add to",0,2,1731424284.0

TSMC Predictions,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis:

  
1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

Chipotle Mexican Grill names Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Monday named interim boss Scott Boatwright as permanent CEO of the burrito chain in a widely expected move, months after Brian Niccol exited the role to take the top job at Starbucks.

Boatwright, who has been at Chipotle since 2017, takes the helm as restaurants across the United States battle weak consumer demand in the face of higher menu prices.

In a surprise announcement in August, Starbucks named Niccol as its new CEO, leaving Chipotle under Boatwright, who has vowed to push the burrito chain to be a “global lifestyle brand” and expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America.

A veteran in the restaurant industry, Boatwright spent 18 years with Arby’s Restaurant Group before joining Chipotle in 2017.

He was named CEO following “a thorough and rigorous external search process,” Chipotle said in a statement on Monday.

Boatwright worked closely with Niccol to also steer the company out of a crisis following a severe E. coli and salmonella outbreak in 2015.

“Boatwright was by far the most logical choice given his instrumental role in leading Chipotle’s efforts to improve operations, integrate new technology, reduce employee turnover, and bolster customer satisfaction,” said Sharon Zackfia, analyst at William Blair.

His appointment as CEO comes amid a slew of changes to the top brass at Chipotle following Niccol’s exit. 

In August, Chipotle also accelerated the appointment of Adam Rymer as its chief financial officer, and named Rymer’s predecessor Jack Hartung as chief strategy officer.

Hartung was originally set to retire in March next year after a little over two decades as the company’s CFO. Rymer has been at Chipotle for 15 years, last serving as vice president of finance. 

“Boatwright as CEO should build confidence among investors in Chipotle’s management,” said Jim Sanderson, analyst at Northcoast Research. 

Chipotle’s stock lost $6 billion in market value immediately after Niccol’s departure. Since then, shares have risen about 14%.

Investing in Modern Day Valuations,"Hi all! 

Long time lurker here (26M) who is looking for some general advice.

I do quarterly rebalancing for my personal portfolio, though I offset it slightly (mid-Feb, May, Aug, and Nov rather than the standard end-of-quarter timing). This past quarter was a strong one—I realized significant gains thanks to the market’s recent surge (up 98% YTD), which leaves me in a unique position as I plan my next moves.

Right now, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. The market feels extremely saturated, yet I also hesitate to sit on the sidelines or try to time a correction. I want to be thoughtful about redeploying my gains, but I’m not seeing many places to confidently put new money to work.

How are others in the community building conviction in their holdings? It feels like I keep hearing two extremes: either people are incredibly bullish, riding the wave, or they’re wary of a correction—yet staying fully invested in names like Costco, which is trading at a 56 P/E.

Such as Apple, S&P 500 EFT, Tesla, Nasdaq 100 EFF, Meta, and others.

This compares to NVDA's 4.2% weighting in the average retail portfolio a year ago

NVDA's popularity is largely due to its rapidly rising stock price, earnings reports that have repeatedly beaten expectations, and retail investors' preference for tech stocks - over the past year, NVDA's stock price has risen 203%, and in the second quarter, NVDA's revenues of $30 billion were up 15% sequentially and 122% year-on-year, well above the $28 billion estimate",215,71,1731352880.0
Lumber futures? ,"Hello! I saw on another, unrelated sub someone mentioned that in the last Trump administration they traded in lumber futures because of the tariffs. 

I am not an expert in this by any stretch of the imagination. Can some folks weigh in on whether they think it would make sense to trade in lumber futures this time around? Considering the proposed tariffs are likely to raise the costs across the board, and the federal ability to respond to disasters like hurricanes (which require a lot of lumber in the aftermath) may be hampered depending on how much organizations like FEMA stay intact.

Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined,"[https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/](https://fortune.com/2024/11/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-election-tesla-auto-industry-carmakers-market-value/)

>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.

>On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter.

>Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai.

US Tech Stocks will push back against EU pressure as Trump signals tariffs and 'America First' policies,"Honestly, it feels like Apple and the whole US tech sector are finally standing up to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and all the over-the-top regulations. With Trump hinting at tariffs and pushing that ""America First"" vibe, the U.S. tech giants might finally have the leverage to say ""no thanks"" to a lot of the stuff Europe’s trying to force on them. The DMA is supposed to keep things competitive, but for companies like Apple, it’s just restrictive and honestly impacts their ability to innovate. If the U.S. government throws its weight behind them, these companies could really start pulling back from Europe’s grip and go about their business without being bogged down by EU red tape.



Europe’s supposed to be an innovation hub, but it’s really starting to look like the opposite. For startups, the endless admin, complex regulations, and sky-high taxes make it pretty much impossible to thrive. You have great ideas coming out of Europe, but the bureaucracy and costs just suffocate them before they can take off. Compare that to the U.S., where taxes are lower and there’s way less red tape, and you can see why so many are ditching Europe altogether. It’s like the EU’s digging its own grave when it comes to tech innovation, and the U.S. might be there to pick up the pieces.

The biggest problem with fast fashion brands is that they tend to rise fast and fall fast; to form a brand moat, they still need more than a decade of precipitation.

So the observation of ELF is mainly to see whether its hotness in the United States can be sustained, as well as the development of overseas markets;

Overall, fast fashion beauty, because of its low technology and high profit, belongs to the products that need strong marketing, and it is considered a good idea to use new media + Netflix as the main marketing method.",51,23,1731339560.0
What is pushing SOFI to a different stratosphere after it is up 54.64% in 1 Month,"Lower volume is usually expected today correlated with no Bond trading on this Veterans Day. With $13 Options in the Money this past Friday and the Option Chain bullish at $15 by the end of this week, it is possible to see a spike in SoFi stock today given the combination of Shorts%, Low volume, Options in the Money, and the positive sentiment from the bullish Option Chain.

Plus the following:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* As of June 2024, Americans owe about $1.6 trillion in student loans, 42% more than they owed a decade earlier.  SoFi has approximately 60% of the private student loan refinancing market.
* SoFi has reached 1 year of full profitability after Q3 2024.
* Institutional ownership is the highest it has ever been at 45.6% (Probably even higher when the new number comes out)
* SoFi wants to get loans from high-quality borrowers with high FICO scores. They were rejecting about 80% of the applicants.  They can easily raise that risk and jump their business as long as it stays within the default margin for profitability.   Their large increase in customers every quarter allows them to get low-cost funding for lending out money given their bank charter status, unlike many other Fintechs that don't have a bank charter.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely abandon the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price jumps.
* Bank stock rose 20% three months after the election in 2016.",178,56,1731330545.0
Is there still runway for $TTWO?,"For disclosure: I bought in TTWO at a cost basis around 140 last November after the official announcement by Rockstar about GTA 6. I am not looking to hold the stock long-term, but rather capitalise on the short-term wave brought about by GTA 6. My initial exit was 180, but the stock has reached this level almost entirely by the post-election rally, without much accounting for the catalyst I initially had in mind.

I am extremely bullish about the materiality of GTA 6's release on TTWO. Investors were likely anxious if GTA 6 was still able to draw the same hype as its predecessors did, but the official trailer on 6 Nov last year proved so. It broke the world record for highest number of first-day views for a non-music video, and is now the most-liked game trailer of all time. In response, share price increased by 20% over the next month as the market geared for more news. I continue to believe GTA 6 will be wildly popular with the general public - drawing milennials for nostalgia's sake and Gen Z (and onwards) who finally have a GTA title of their own generation.

For comparison, GTA 5 sold 11m copies and 800m in revenue within the first 24 hours. Analysts expect GTA 6 to eclipse 1B revenue in the first day, which already equals an entire quarter's worth of revenue. I believe these estimates are rather conservative, given how far the console/PC gaming market has advanced over the past decade. It is reasonable to expect GTA 6 to be a complete sell-out given all the reasons above. 

Last week, management finally gave us visibility of a GTA 6 release in Fall of 2025. This is already a bit of a delay given that management had previously hinted at a ""significant inflection point"" in 1Q25 which I had read as at least a pre-release. Therefore, there is a material risk that the company further delays the launch again; or worse, the product is a let-down.

I am wondering, if you think that the GTA 6 momentum has already been fully priced in on fundamentals, or if there is still further upside. ",6,25,1731327715.0

Is now the time to bet big on small caps IWM / XSMO or stick with VOO? What about mid-cap (IVOG)?,"I’m planning to rebalance my portfolio by pulling a chunk out of my HYSA to invest in the market. 

I started listening to Tom Lee last December, and for many things, I’m thankful.  However,  he’s been calling for small-cap rotation all year, and now he’s saying they will potentially “outperform by more than 100%” over the next couple of years because they’re trading at a discount relative to large caps. 

After some basic research earlier this year, I divided my investments between VOO (S&P 500), IWM (Russell 2000), XSMO (Momentum Small Cap), and IVOG (Mid Cap).  So far, VOO would have been better. 

I’m typically a long-term investor.  Would I be better off sticking with the tried-and-true VOO or continuing to diversify with small caps? And how does mid-cap IVOG fit into this mix?

SAAB - Swedish arms manufacturer,"Swedish arms manufacturer SAAB is a forgotten gem among European defense stocks. Like all other defense stocks, SAAB gained a lot in the beginning of the Ukraine war and is now trading at around P/E 30 which is historically high and not that impressive.   
  
What makes the stock interesting now is how many orders have been coming in lately and how the price of the stock hasn't skyrocketed further in response, yet at least. Relative to other arms manufacturers, SAAB is not that large and their potential market cap is enormous.  
  
I initially bought a small position in SAAB because I was impressed with the fighter jet Gripen and figured that given the quite small current market cap it just takes 1-3 countries to adopt the Gripen system to massively increase the revenue for SAAB. Nowadays the orders just keep coming in, and the stock price is not really keeping up, so I've bought more shares. Colombia just decided to buy Gripen and Brazil is going to expand their fleet.  
Apart from Gripen, which is of course the crown jewel of SAABs products they also make the NLAW anti tank missile, AT4 anti tank missiles, radar systems, top tier camouflage fabrics and a lot of other high tech defense related products.

Future of Energy Stocks ,"So I've been doing some research about energy stocks, here are some of my thoughts:

Clean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:

1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.

2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.

3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.

4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst.

Reuters Exclusive: US ordered TSMC to halt shipments to China of chips used in AI applications,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers that are often used in artificial intelligence applications starting Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Department of Commerce sent a letter to TSMC imposing export restrictions on certain sophisticated chips, of 7 nanometer or more advanced designs, destined for China that power AI accelerator and graphics processing units (GPU), the person said.

The U.S. order, which is being reported for the first time, comes just weeks after TSMC notified the Commerce Department that one of its chips had been found in a Huawei AI processor, as Reuters reported last month. Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.

Huawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.

TSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.

Reuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.

The latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.

As a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.
The Commerce Department declined comment.

A spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a ""law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.""

The Commerce Department communication -- known as an ""is informed"" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.

Ijiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.

The action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.

In 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.

The restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.

The U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.

But despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",476,143,1731200267.0

I am looking at a company stock ticker CE. They are a chemicals company. The recent crash in share price is what prompted me to ""kick the tires"" on this name.

I am looking specifically at their balance sheet.

They have about 12B in long term debt. They made a big acquisition a few years back for about 10B. They essentially have 12B of bonds of which about 1B come due every year.

This year, they did not make enough money to pay off their bonds so they drew down 1B from their cash to pay off their bond. Now they only have 800m cash left. They anticipate that they cannot pay off their 2025 bonds and have already arranged short term financing to pay it off. Their debt coverage ratio is 1.4.

They are shutting down plants left and right to save money. They cut their dividend by 95%.

My question is simple. Considering the state of their finances (it's very bad not sugarcoating it), is this a good investment at current price? And if not, is there a price at which you would be interested?",9,7,1731165697.0
"Wendy's Uses Palantir AI Tech To Manage Burger, French Fry Inventories says Return On Investment Is 'Significant'","https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/11/41817215/wendys-uses-palantir-ai-tech-to-manage-burger-french-fry-inventories-return-on-investment-is-signifi

> Wendy's supply chain purchases are handled by an independent co-op group that first tested Palantir's technology last year amid tight profit margins and increasing pressure from inflation, according to a Bloomberg report. The group is using Palantir's system to spot shortages and suggest solutions like placing an order from a supplier. Pete Suerken, who leads the purchasing co-op, said the system's AI learns over time and can suggest a specific warehouse, after considering factors such as cost and the probability of the items arriving on time. The software can predict when specific products will run out by analyzing current and historical sales figures.

> Suerken praised Palantir's platform and said it was ""so much better"" than spreadsheets and other customary inventory management methods. He also said the return on investment is ""significant."" Wendy's recently asked the supply chain program to identify shortages restaurants could face over the following three weeks and then staff trained the model by showing how the shortages should be solved. Wendy's purchasing group plans to eventually allow the AI model to manage smaller inventory and ordering tasks autonomously and without human intervention.

> ""Three or four years from now, if you're not doing this, you'll be at a distinct disadvantage,"" said Suerken. ""This is something that, as an industry, will change the way we work.""",730,126,1731163077.0
Diversifying my Portfolio (ASX),"Hey all,

I recently got into Stocks last week

I deposited so far $10k into VAS Top 300 AU, $10k into VGS International (This one has been underperforming also tempted to sell it for another international ETF which has less companies in it any recommendations on ETF's of this type to look into?, $10k into NDQ Tech 100, $2800 into CSL and $67k into the S&P500 (IVV)

(Made a mistake with the CSL because it hae a weighting of over 5% in VAS but I am not sure if its bad to sell it for another stock because Tax reasons? Can someone advise me if I should just leave it?

I constantly hear some people talk about just putting all or 99% into S&P500 and then I hear the opposite argument of needing to be diversified in not just US and AUS but also WW and also even at what percentages you should have in each Stock

Personally for this reason I did put some of my Stocks into AUS and WW (As per above) but because of the past think the returns on the S&P500 will be better hence why I have overweighted it (I know the past does not have to repeat iself) but my risk tolerance is somewhat high being married at 30 with no kids and wanting to make my first million ASAP but I am feeling like maybe I have far too high a weighting in the USA is my main question, and if I do with my remaining 50k is it worth sacrificing potential returns from S&P 500 to diversify more? i'd love opinions on this because current plan is just to go ham on the S&P500

Do you all think this is a good strategy or I should really make an effort to Diversify more? Also I was thinking of buying VHY because I do not have many good Dividend Stocks yet, any advice welcome I only started investing a week ago",7,1,1731159480.0

"MBLY is the next Trump / Elon stock. 10 bagger
","MBLY (Mobileye) is the leader in autonomous driving technology supplying automakers. Elon will push Trump to encourage the expansion of autonomous driving for his Tesla Full Self Driving and robotaxis. Only three companies can do full autonomous driving: Tesla, Google’s Waymo, and Mobileye. Automakers will have to respond and they aren’t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY.

MBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day, we may get more announcements. A year from now, all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY.

Each customer like Volkswagen is \~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP). MBLY’s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028, MBLY’s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today.

Are the NANC and CRUZ tracking ETF’s a good investment you're implementing in your portfolio?,"With all the talk this election about congressional insider trading and looking at these various Saas and ETF options that follow US representative trades I was curious what y'all perspective was on these and if you're taking them seriously at all as a diversification play or if they are just kind of meme ETF's.

The NANC ETF aims to track the stock trades made by members of Congress and their spouses, focusing on trades involving Democratic members. As of September 30, 2024, NANC hit a one-year total return of about 40%, Whoa, which outpaces the S&P 500's gain of around 22% over the same period​.

On the other hand, the KRUZ ETF, which tracks trades by Republican members of Congress, has generally shown competitive returns but with less gains than NANC. 

Both ETFs seem to be a part of a broader trend in thematic investing that targets political market behavior which is interesting. Their management fees/expense ratio are both 0.75% which feels super high compared to like VOO (.03%).

These are both relatively new. And presumably could also be made obsolete if certain legislation passes that bans Congressional reps from investing while serving. 

Just wanted to get others take on these. Appreciate your time!

Lyft Achieves Record-Breaking Q3 2024 with Surge in Riders and Revenue,"I added more Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) shares this morning at $17.50 following their excellent Q3-2024 results. I had first started buying Lyft last month at $13.50.

Lyft demonstrated remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2024, posting significant gains in both operational metrics and financial performance. The rideshare giant reported record-breaking numbers in active riders and total rides, while substantially improving its financial position through increased revenue and robust cash flow generation.

# STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

**Excellent revenue, EBITDA and Cash Flow growth** 

* **Gross Bookings**: Reached $4.1 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase
* **Revenue**: Hit $1.5 billion, showing substantial growth of 32% year-over-year
* **Net Loss**: Posted $(12.4) million, including a $36.4 million restructuring charge
* **Adjusted EBITDA**: Achieved $107.3 million, up from $92.0 million in Q3'23
* **Free Cash Flow**: Generated $242.8 million, a significant improvement from $(30.0) million in Q3'23

**Solid Operational Achievements**

The company set new records in its core operational metrics:

* Reached 24.4 million Active Riders (9% YoY growth)
* Delivered 217 million Rides (16% YoY growth)
* Maintained strong driver engagement with record driver hours

**Strategic Initiatives In Autonomous Vehicles**

Lyft announced significant partnerships in the autonomous vehicle space, positioning itself for future growth:

* Formed alliances with Mobileye, May Mobility, and Nexar
* Plans to launch autonomous vehicle service in Atlanta by 2025

**Strategic Partnership with DoorDash**

* Established collaboration with DoorDash, the leading U.S. local delivery platform
* Introduced exclusive benefits for DashPass members using Lyft services

# WEAKNESSES AND CHALLENGES

* Secondary player to Uber (UBER) in the rideshare market, only 30% market share compared to Uber’s 70%.
* Doesn’t have the secondary revenue stream of Uber Eats to absorb fixed costs
* Smaller market share and geographic footprint
* Limited brand recognition internationally
* Heavy reliance on incentives to attract/retain drivers and riders
* High customer acquisition costs
* Competitive pressure on pricing

**Wall Street seems to like it as well**

“We think the strong after-hours move is deserved,” Sanderson adds, and think the results will ease concern about Lyft’s ability to grow profitably. “But management’s 15% multi-year \[gross bookings\] target will still be a debate, as will the company’s position for autonomous vehicles.”

“Efficiencies are driving EBITDA ahead of expectations, and the profitability of the rides business model shined, even through increased investment into rider/demand-based incentives,” Morgan Stanley’s Nowak added, raising his FY25/26 adjusted EBITDA estimates by 9% and 2%, respectively, contributing to a higher price target of $18 from $16, previously.

BofA Securities also lifted its price target, now at $19, as the company has “seemingly limited incremental share losses, focusing on core customers and commuters that are still growing order frequency.”

“We have a Buy rating on Lyft as tailwinds from mobility/transportation recovery in urban areas are outweighing risk factors like driver wage inflation, inflation’s impact on consumer travel, and competition risk from Uber and new autonomous entrants,” BofA’s Michael McGovern and Justin Post said in their research note.

**Continuing to accumulate for 3-5 years.**

Lyft has a long way to go, but the first and second quarter of adjusted operating profits in a row and strong cash flow generation suggest that it is a serious competitor to Uber.

I had recommended and started buying Lyft in October around $13-$14, calling it an attractive GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price), and a very reasonable valuation compared to Uber, which is unlikely to have a monopoly in the ride-sharing market.

Lyft deserves a seat at the table and with excellent Q3 results and raised guidance it looks even more compelling. Sure, there was a massive bump from $14 to $17. post earnings but the valuation is still attractive at 1.1x sales for 12-15% sales growth and at 17x earnings for a 15-17% grower.

The same thing happened with DFEN (a leveraged ETF). I bought it at $35 couple weeks ago, it dropped to $32, and after the election, I sold it at $35.10, as I was just trying to recoup my money, thinking it would continue to decline after the hype. Now the stock is at $37.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

This feels ridiculous, but I am often profoundly ignorant when it comes to stocks, so someone will probably point out why it's a good idea/required/a sacrifice to the gods/etc.

Secondly, I am at a loss as to why there is *ever* a significant gap between the two ... let alone one in favor of the non-voting shares.  The only two reasons I can think of is laziness and/or confusion.  It's like having two gas stations right next to each other sharing the same driveway, they should either be exactly the same price-per-gallon or so close that by the time you finish driving up to the cheaper option, the more expensive one has already moved its price downwards.",13,9,1731017513.0
Pinterest stock plunges following weak Q4 revenue guidance,"Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.

Here’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:

* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected
* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected

The company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.

Sales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.

Pinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  

The company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.

Pinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.

Last week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.

Alphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.

Reddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.

Airbnb stock up 8% as revenue jumps,"Airbnb reported third-quarter earnings on Thursday that were shy of analyst estimates, though it squeaked in a small revenue beat. The stock jumped about 8% in after-hours trading.

Here’s how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.13 vs. $2.14 expected by LSEG
* **Revenue:** $3.73 billion vs. $3.72 billion expected by LSEG

Revenue increased 10% from $3.4 billion a year earlier. Airbnb reported a net income of $1.37 billion, or $2.13 per share, compared to $4.37 billion, or $6.63 per share, in the same period last year.

The company expects to report revenue between $2.39 billion and $2.44 billion during its fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.42 billion for the period, according to LSEG.

In its letter to shareholders, Airbnb said it is focused on expanding beyond its core markets and into under-penetrated markets around the globe. The average growth rate of nights booked in Airbnb’s expansion markets was double that of its core markets on an origin basis during the third quarter, the company said.

“We’ll remain focused on accelerating growth while preparing for Airbnb’s next chapter, which will take us beyond accommodations,” Airbnb said. “You’ll see more on this next year.”

Airbnb said adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $2 billion, up 7% year over year. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting $1.86 billion.

Gross booking value, used by Airbnb to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $20.1 billion in the third quarter. That’s above the $19.9 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. The company reported 123 million nights and experiences booked, up 8% from a year ago, and higher than the 121.4 million expected by StreetAccount.

Airbnb said it saw hosting growth across all regions and market types during the third quarter. The company has more than 8 million active listings and has worked to improve listing quality, according to its shareholder letter. Airbnb has removed more than 300,000 listings since last year.

Average daily rates increased 1% from a year ago to $164 in the third quarter, the company said.

Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point,"**Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter point**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html)

*The Federal Reserve approved its second consecutive interest rate cut Thursday, moving at a less aggressive pace than before but continuing its efforts to right-size monetary policy.*  
  
*In a follow-up to September’s big half percentage point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%. The rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but often influences consumer debt instruments such as mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.*  
  
*Markets had widely expected the move, which was telegraphed both at the September meeting and in follow-up remarks from policymakers since then. The vote was unanimous, unlike the previous move that saw the first “no” vote from a Fed governor since 2005. This time, Governor Michelle Bowman went along with the decision.*  
  
*The post-meeting statement reflected a few tweaks in how the Fed views the economy. Among them was an altered view in how it assesses the effort to bring down inflation while supporting the labor market.*  
*“The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,” the document stated, a change from September when it noted “greater confidence” in the process.*  
*Fed officials have justified the easing mode for policy as they view supporting employment becoming at least as much a priority as arresting inflation.*  
*On the labor market, the statement said “conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.” The committee again said the economy “has continued to expand at a solid pace.“*  
*Officials have largely framed the change in policy as an attempt to get the rate structure back in line with an economy where inflation is drifting back to the central bank’s 2% target while the labor market has shown some indications of softening. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has spoken of “recalibrating” policy back to where it no longer needs to be as restrictive as it was when the central bank focused almost solely on taming inflation.*  
*Powell will answer questions about the decision at his 2:30 news conference. The November meeting was moved back a day due to the presidential election.*  
*There is uncertainty over how far the Fed will need to go with cuts as the macro economy continues to post solid growth and inflation remains a stifling problem for U.S. households.*  
*Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8% pace in the third quarter, less than expected and slightly below the Q2 level but still above the historical trend for the U.S. around 1.8%-2%. Preliminary tracking for the fourth quarter is pointing to growth around 2.4%, according to the Atlanta Fed.*  
*Generally, the labor market has held up well. However, nonfarm payrolls increased by just by 12,000 in October, though the weakness was attributed in part to storms in the Southeast and labor strikes.*  
*The decision comes amid a changing political backdrop.*  
*President-elect Donald Trump scored a stunning victory in Tuesday’s election. Economists largely expect his policies to pose challenges for inflation, with his stated intentions of punitive tariffs and mass deportations for undocumented immigrants. In his first term, however, inflation held low while economic growth, outside of the initial phase of the Covid pandemic, held strong.*  
*Still, Trump was a fierce critic of Powell and his colleagues during his first stint in office, and the chair’s term expires in early 2026. Central bankers assiduously steer clear of commenting on political matters, but the Trump dynamic could be an overhang for the course of policy ahead.*  
*An acceleration in economic activity under Trump could persuade the Fed to cut rates less, depending on how inflation reacts.*  
*Questions have arisen over what the “terminal” point is for the Fed, or the point at which it will decide it has cut enough and has its benchmark rate where it is neither pushing nor holding back growth. Traders expect the Fed likely will approve another quarter-point cut in December then pause in January as it assesses the impact of its tightening moves, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.*  
*The FOMC indicated in September that members expected a half percentage point more in cuts by the of this year and then another full percentage point in 2025.*  
*The September “dot plot” of individual officials’ expectations pointed to a terminal rate of 2.9%, which would imply another half percentage point of cuts in 2026.*  
*Even with the Fed lowering rates, markets have not responded in kind.*  
*Treasury yields have jumped higher since the September cut, as have mortgage rates. The 30-year mortgage, for instance, has climbed about 0.7 percentage point to 6.8%, according to Freddie Mac. The 10-year Treasury yield is up almost as much.*  
*The Fed is seeking to achieve a “soft landing” for the economy in which it can bring down inflation without causing a recession. The Fed’s preferred inflation indicator most recently showed a 2.1% 12-month rate, though the so-called core, which excludes food and energy and is generally considered a better long-run indicator, was at 2.7%.*

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*

*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*

*In support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*

*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*

*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller.*",1018,120,1731006139.0

Qualcomm pops on chipmaker's earnings and revenue beat,"Qualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.

The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%.

Here’s how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:

Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expected

Revenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expected

Qualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.

The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year’s $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.

Qualcomm’s fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.

Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.

“In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,” said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts.

Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.

“We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts.

Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn’t produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis.

The company’s “internet of things” business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.

Qualcomm’s chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. 

The company’s profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.

Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.

E.l.f. shares soar as cosmetics retailer raises guidance after posting 40% sales gain,"E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. 

Shares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.

The cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. 

Here’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected

Revenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  

Sales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. 

E.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. 

The cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. 

“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” 

Amin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. 

During the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. 

Tang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. 

“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” 

The company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. 

Amin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.

Post-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.

1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)

"Toyota posts nearly 20% drop in second-quarter operating profit, missing estimates","Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.

Here are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.

Revenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen

Operating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen

The world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.

Net profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.

The automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.

Still, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.

Toyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.

“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.

“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”

The company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.

Toyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.

The latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.

Early in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.

The wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase going into a much friendlier upcoming environment for financial institutions.,"SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase and its growth will dramatically benefit from the upcoming much friendlier environment for financial institutions:

* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.
* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.
* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.
* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.
* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.
* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price rises.
* There is a 97.4% chance of a 25 bp rate cut for this upcoming Fed meeting tomorrow, Nov. 7th. which would already meet the 75 bp cut that SoFi's CEO has predicted for this year to facilitate SoFi's rapid growth.
* Bank stock rose 20% three months after the election in 2016.",95,19,1730896662.0

Vanguard deposes BlackRock as provider of world’s second-largest ETF,"Inflows to VOO look set to smash records as observers predict it will soon overtake SPY to become the biggest

Vanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.

In a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.

“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year. In contrast, SPY has seen $5bn in outflows. The $125bn gap between the two ETFs [VOO and SPY] has shrunk to under $50bn in 2024. Were that pace to continue, VOO would easily be crowned king in 2025.”

Super Micro Computer- SMCI $26 - Avoid Till We Get Restated Financials,"**I think Super Micro Computer, (SMCI) should be avoided for the following reasons:**

**Restatements could alter the financials significantly:** The odds are high that the company will end up restating past financials. The Auditor’s resignation, its CEO’s pay package, and its past settlement with the SEC in 2018 all suggest that SMCI will have to restate its financial statements.

**No 10K:** SMCI has delayed its annual 10-K filing and without an audited 10K, we have precious little faith in the numbers. 

**SMCI has priors:** This was not their first time. In 2018, the company settled charges with the [SEC for improper accounting](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-190). As stated in the article from the SEC website….

>

**Tainted:** To me the alleged malfeasance creates significant doubts for investors that will not go away for a while, and it's very likely that Wall Street will not touch it, fearing liability for not doing enough due diligence. Also, I can’t imagine SMCI getting a decent multiple in the future for the same reasons until faith is restored in management and its books.

**Possible Loan Default:**  There is a significant risk of Super Micro defaulting on the company's Term Loan Agreement with Bank of America. 

**Compensation tied to aggressive revenue targets**: The CEO’s unusual compensation package, with virtually no base salary and bonuses tied to very aggressive revenue and share price targets, is a dangerous and potentially abusive practice.

**Possible delisting from the Nasdaq, and getting thrown out of the S&P 500**: The chances of both are high as a new auditor needs to be found, and a substantial amount of restatement work needs to be done.

**A great business:** Sure, SMCI has a great server liquid cooling business, which has tremendous potential and demand for server racks for AI GPUs, right now and for the foreseeable future. However, as we saw Nvidia has already started shifting this business.

**Ignore the low valuation:** I’m going to ignore the current low valuation of 8x earnings and 0.5x sales, which are much lower than competitors such as Dell (DELL) and Oracle (ORCL), simply because I have no idea what the restated financials will look like, and the valuation could be a lot different

The only way I would invest is the possibility of a merger/acquisition/White Knight, that will keep the stock afloat. The CEO owns close to 10% of the company so I doubt if he would let this go without a fight.

The other problem I foresee is the difficulty of getting good and timely information. For the most part, we rely on analysts who expect a proper set of books. Instead of focusing on the fundamentals, we’ll be spending far too much time, and worse without success trying to figure out what is genuine or not, It would make better sense to invest in other GPU/semiconductor businesses.

How will inflate your debt away work in a country like US?,"I am trying to figure out if long term bonds are worth the risk in case future govt in collusion with Fed decides to keep rates low even if inflation is high.

Can anyone write play by play like how it may happen. I am going to try first below:

1. Say in 2025 inflation is still above 2.6% and economic activity points to strong labor market and GDP growth of 3% but still congress approves tax cuts for everyone at the cost of deficit. They also approve infrastructure projects costing trillions in deficit. But Fed continues to cut rates. Fed helps the govt fund it's deficit by buying treasury bonds if demand is low considering real yield is zero or negative.
2. Inflation goes much higher due to higher spending by businesses and consumers but Fed does not raise rates.
3. Say they tolerate inflation upto 5-6% while keeping short term rates at 3% or lower and forcing long term treasury rate below 4% because of fed buying them.

This will have the effect of debt being discounted every year by 2-3% just like how it has happened between 2020 to 2023.

I have seen developing countries like India tolerate inflation level of 10-12% every year resulting in their debt value getting reduced by 90% in 15-20 years, while their GDP keeps growing. Is it wrong to expect this from a mature economy like USA?",0,16,1730826160.0

Covered Calls hoping for execution Risks?,"I am new to covered calls, and I know that the typical strategy is hoping that the call is not executed and just collecting money from premiums.

It's like buying a 100's stocks that you think are decent but then going down the option chain and selling a 2-year contract with a strike price of a couple $ of or even cents over, knowing that the shares will be called away.

  
I know that obviously, there is the downside that your stock goes below and is more in the red than your premium. But say a company is trading at $4 right now, so $400 for 100 shares. and a 2 year contract call is at $5 strike at $250 premium. 

Is it a good strategy to hope that you get that $100 + the $250 premium, ignoring the opportunity costs or are there risks I'm over looking",6,11,1730820195.0
"Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers","So, will there be any new car model for Tesla in 2025???

&#x200B;

**Musk now says it's 'pointless' to build a $25,000 Tesla for human drivers**  
[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-now-says-its-pointless-build-25000-tesla-human-drivers-2024-11-05)

&#x200B;

*When Reuters reported in April that Tesla had scrapped plans for a long-promised, next-generation $25,000 electric vehicle, the automaker’s stock plunged. Chief Executive Elon Musk rushed to respond on X, his social-media network.*  
*“Reuters is lying,” he posted, without elaborating. Tesla’s stock recovered some of its losses.*  
*Six months later, Musk appears to have backed into an admission that Tesla dropped its plans for a human-driven $25,000 car. He said in an Oct. 23 earnings call that building the affordable EV would be ""pointless” unless the car was fully autonomous.*  
*His latest remarks came in response to an investor asking: “When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non-robotaxi regular car model?”*  
*Musk responded: “We’re not making a non-robo…,” before he was interrupted by another Tesla executive. Musk later added: “Basically, I think having a regular $25K model is pointless. It would be silly.”*  
*The April 5 Reuters article reported that Tesla had abandoned plans for an all-new, affordable mass-market EV but still planned a self-driving robotaxi. Since then, Musk has increasingly touted plans for robotaxis and autonomous vehicles.*  
*Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this story.*  
*On the October earnings call, Musk said that Tesla does plan a “$25K car” – its “Cybercab,” a two-door, two-seat, fully autonomous vehicle. Musk unveiled a prototype at a Hollywood-style event on Oct. 10.*  
*Musk says Tesla will start production of the Cybercab in 2026, after it deploys fully autonomous versions of its current Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in Texas and California next year. The automaker faces steep technological, regulatory and legal challenges in delivering on Musk’s latest promises of fully autonomous vehicles, which echo others dating back about a decade.*  
*An all-new affordable Tesla for human drivers had until recently been a linchpin of Tesla’s strategy to become the world’s biggest automaker. For several years, Tesla had a goal of producing 20 million vehicles a year by 2030, more than tenfold what it sells now and nearly double that of Toyota, the current global sales leader. In May, Tesla dropped the 20-million goal from its latest “impact report” on progress toward sustainability goals.*  
*As recently as January of this year, Musk confirmed the plan for an all-new affordable EV in an earnings call. He said the next-generation vehicle would arrive in 2025 and launch a second major ""growth wave,” following the first wave with the release of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in 2017 and 2020, respectively.*  
*Investors and Tesla fans commonly called the anticipated cheap car a “Model 2,” slotting in below the Model 3, currently the least-expensive Tesla, starting at $42,490.*  
*In January, Musk described the all-new model as requiring “new revolutionary manufacturing technology.” But in April, after Reuters reported Tesla had scrapped the Model 2, Musk outlined a plan for “more affordable” models that could be produced “on the same manufacturing lines” as current Teslas.*  
*Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar Research Services analyst, said he believes these less-expensive vehicles will be built on current Tesla platforms and priced in the mid-$30,000s.*  
*“It was my understanding that the original plan was to make the more-affordable vehicle on a new platform,” he told Reuters. “I think Tesla realized they were late to making an affordable vehicle versus their Chinese-EV peers … So, they changed their strategy rather than make a large investment to produce a new vehicle.”*  
*After the April 5 Reuters report that Tesla had killed the Model 2, Musk posted that day on X saying Tesla planned a “robotaxi unveil” in August. The event, delayed until October and held on a movie set near Los Angeles, underwhelmed Wall Street and drove a 9% drop in Tesla shares the following day.*  
*Some investors viewed Musk’s comments on the Cybercab – along with displays of an autonomous “Robovan” concept and humanoid robots – as short on concrete details about the products. Tesla hasn’t said whether the Cybercab will feature new self-driving technology beyond the company’s “Full Self-Driving” feature in its current vehicles. Its existing models can’t fully drive themselves and require a human driver paying strict attention.*  
*The target market for the Cybercab isn’t clear. The Cybercab’s sports-car looks and two-door, two-seat configuration – a nearly extinct layout in the wider U.S. auto market – puzzled some analysts who expected a robotaxi with more room for passengers and luggage.*  
*Musk, in the October earnings call, said the concept vehicle’s design was “optimized for autonomy” and would also deliver affordability.*  
*“It will cost … roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car,” Musk said. “It just won't have a steering wheel and pedals.”*",757,381,1730815541.0
Burger King parent Restaurant Brands falls short of Q3 revenue expectations,"Restaurant Brands International on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as domestic same-store sales growth for all four of its chains fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expected

Revenue: $2.29 billion vs. $2.31 billion expected

Restaurant Brands reported third-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $252 million, or 79 cents per share, unchanged from a year earlier.

Excluding items, the company earned 93 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 24.7% to $2.29 billion, largely thanks to the company’s acquisitions of its largest U.S. Burger King franchisee and its Popeyes business in China earlier this year.

The company’s worldwide same-store sales grew just 0.3% in the quarter. Burger King, Firehouse Subs and Popeyes all reported same-store sales declines in their home markets.

Burger King’s same-store sales fell 0.7%. The chain is in the middle of a turnaround in the U.S., but consumers are also spending less at restaurants, reigniting the value wars between Burger King and its rivals.

Popeyes reported same-store sales declines of 4%. In June, the chain launched boneless wings as a permanent menu item for the first time in its history.

Firehouse Subs saw its same-store sales shrink 4.8% in the quarter. The sandwich chain is the latest addition to Restaurant Brands’ portfolio, as of 2021, and the smallest brand by footprint with just 1,300 locations as of the end of the third quarter.

Tim Hortons was the top performer, with domestic same-store sales growth of 2.3%. But the Canadian coffee chain still fell short of Wall Street’s same-store sales growth expectations of 4.1%, based on StreetAccount estimates.

Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands’ international same-store sales rose 1.8% in the quarter, just shy of estimates of 2.2%.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco posts 15% drop in third-quarter profit but maintains dividend,"Saudi state oil giant Aramco reported a 15.4% drop in net profit in the third-quarter on the back of “lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” but maintained a 31.05 billion dividend.

The company reported net income of $27.56 billion in the July-September period, topping a company-provided estimate of $26.9 billion. The print is also a 5% drop from the previous quarter, which came in at $29.1 billion, as lower global oil prices, weaker demand and prolonged OPEC+ production cuts led by Saudi Arabia continue to impact crude prices.

The average selling price of oil for the second quarter of 2024 stood at $85 per barrel, but dropped to $78.7 per barrel during the third quarter, according to Saudi-based bank Al Rajhi capital, as non-OPEC supply volumes grew.

The oil firm said its year-on-year decline was partly offset by a “reduction in selling, administrative and general expenses primarily driven by a gain from derivative instruments, and a decrease in production royalties largely reflecting lower crude oil prices and a lower average effective royalty rate compared to the same quarter last year.”

Aramco’s dividend includes a base payout of $20.3 billion and an atypical performance-linked one of $10.8 billion. The Saudi government and the kingdom’s sovereign wealth vehicle, the Public Investment Fund, are the main beneficiaries of the dividend, holding stakes of roughly 81.5% and 16% in the company.

The remaining shareholding trades freely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadāwul stock exchange, with the company having finalized its second public share offering back in June.

Aramco’s earnings before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) came in at $51.45 billion in the third quarter, down 17% year-on-year. Aramco’s capital expenditure guidance was brought up 20% to $13.23 billion.

The company was trading at 27.45 riyals following the announcement, down 0.18% on the previous day.

The earnings align with a broader trend across oil majors, whose third-quarter profits have also suffered from declines in crude prices and refining margins. Aramco said it achieved average realized crude price of $79.3 per barrel in the third quarter, compared with $89.3 per barrel in the same period of last year.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter who produces roughly 9 million barrels per day of crude at present, serves as the de facto leader of the OPEC+ oil producers’ alliance, a subset of whom agreed over the weekend to delay a planned December output hike by one month.

“Aramco delivered robust net income and generated strong free cash flow during the third quarter, despite a lower oil price environment,” CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “We also progressed our upstream developments, strengthened our downstream value chain, and advanced our new energies program as we continue to invest through cycles.”

The revenues will be a boon to the Saudi economy, which is currently undergoing a diversification process under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s legacy Vision 2030 scheme spanning a slew of high-cost infrastructure “gigaprojects.”

Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance cut the kingdom’s growth forecast to 0.8% in 2024, in a steep decline from a previous projection of 4.4%, and raised the outlook for the national budgetary shortfall to roughly 2.9% of GDP, from a prior indication of 1.9%.

>The Kyoto-based gaming company sold 4.7 million Switch consoles in the first half of the financial year, down from 6.8 million units in the same period a year earlier.

>Nintendo lowered its full-year sales forecast for the console, which is in its eighth year on the market, by 7% to 12.5 million units. That would be down 20% from actual Switch sales of 15.7 million units a year earlier.

>It also revised down its annual software sales forecast by 3% to 160 million units.

>Furukawa said there was no change to Nintendo's plan to announce a successor to its long-lasting Switch console in the current financial year to March, but did not go into specifics.

>""Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult ... You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season,"" Yasuda said.

>Shares in Nintendo closed down 3.9% ahead of the earnings announcement, underperforming the Nikkei average's 1.1% gain.

""" Boeing workers vote to accept deal, end strike ""","https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/business/boeing-strike-vote-hnk-intl/index.html


New York CNN  — 

Striking workers at embattled plane maker Boeing voted Monday to accept the company’s most recent offer, ending the costliest strike in the United States in more than 25 years.

The International Association of Machinists (IAM) said rank-and-file members voted by 59% to approve the deal. IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.

“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”

Asked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”

Boeing said it was pleased with the outcome.

“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”

The 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.

The deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.

Workers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.

Workers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.
Pension problem

Holden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.

“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”

Companies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.

Such plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.

Boeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.

“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”
Leadership support

Union leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”

The strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.

Those losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.

But despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.

The wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.
Boeing’s economic impact

Despite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.

The strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.
What do you think?
View Comments

The Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.

There have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.

Those problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.

Ending the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.

Nvidia Overtakes Apple to Become World's Largest Company,"
Nvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.

Nvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.

That gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Continued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.

""We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,"" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.

The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks: It Has to Do With Data,"Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   
  
I've been working on an ""investment thesis"" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  


**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  
  
**Current Market Narrative**  
◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  
◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  
  
**The Real Bottleneck**  
AI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  
◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  
◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  
◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  
  
While data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  
◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  
◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  
◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  
  
Emerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  
  
**Key Takeaways:**  
◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  
◾ The ""data wall"" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  
◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  
◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  
◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.

**Overvaluation Risks**  
◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  
◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  
◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  
  
**Hidden Opportunities**  
◾ Companies with unique data access  
◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  
◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  
  
**Regulatory Considerations**  
◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  
◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  
◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional ""data silos""  
◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  
  
**Investment Framework**  
**Key Questions:**  
◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  
◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  
◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   
◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  
  
**Risk Indicators:**  
◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  
◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  
◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  
◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  
  
**Portfolio Implications**  
**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  
◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  
◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  
◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  
  
**Emerging Players:**  
◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  
◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  
◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  
  
**The Long View**  
◾ The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  
◾ ""Data wars"" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  
◾ AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  
  
**Questions for Investors**  
◾ How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  
◾ What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  
◾ How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?

I hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI. I'm eager to hear others' thoughts on these potential market dynamics and data challenges in the journey towards general artificial intelligence. ",74,49,1730730157.0
New York Times adds fewer digital subscribers as spending tightens,"New York Times posted fewer-than-expected digital subscribers for the third quarter as readers cut back on spending in an uncertain economy, offsetting strong growth in advertising sales.

The company added 260,000 digital-only subscribers, compared with 300,000 additions in the previous quarter. Analysts expected the company to add 280,200 subscribers, according to Visible Alpha.

Heightened political advertising in the lead up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election helped the company’s ad revenue of $118.4 million beat analysts’ estimates of $116.93 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.

It reported total revenue of $640.2 million, compared with estimates of $640.8 million.

New York Times forecast subscription revenues to grow by 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, slightly below expectations for 8.2% growth.

Revenue from sports news site The Athletic, purchased by the New York Times in 2022, jumped 29.8% to $44.7 million from $34.4 million a year ago.

Lost in translation (RR CEZ),"Hello, I believe opportunity to beat the market is in finding market ineffectiveness. How much market ineffectiveness do you believe, there is in different information availability between languages?

everybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.

20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. 

Reaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?

*Disclosure: I have 500 shares of RR and 1 RR call, bought this week, and ČEZ shares long term unrelated to this.*",29,7,1730666361.0
Healthcare company with a MOAT ?,"Hey all,

I've been diving deep into the healthcare and defense sector as of late. I found defense much easier to understand as a former military member who dealt directly with most products.

However the healthcare sector has been very tricky. On one hand I look at kvue for their strong branding like tylenol but with the less than attractive valuation & single digit growth projections it's left me searching elsewhere.

The issue I see is I don't find anyone has a moat, novo nordisq was appealing but from what I've gathered their market share on a lot of their product is compromised rather quickly. Ozempic is a strong product but how secure is that product?

I have found other niche such as eye care or senior living reits but nothing quite attracted me.

If you yourself know of companies within the healthcare sector who has a moat I'd love to hear it. Or if there's any healthcare company you have in your portfolio let me know. I'll be doing my own valuation & analysis but suggestions are more than welcomed.",37,69,1730654875.0
"Conflicting numbers for the same dividend, or I just don't understand divs yet","I've got some investment in VOO ETF, I bought 100 shares at 500 bucks each. I got a dividend a month ago for $163 bucks; that's $1.63 a share.

SnowFlake’s Stock Buyback and Short-Term Optimism,"Snowflake recently issued two billion dollars in zero-percent-interest convertible senior notes due in 2027 and 2029, which reflects a high level of confidence from both management and investors about the company’s short-term growth potential. Here’s a breakdown of what this move means and why Snowflake might be taking this route:

The cash from this debt issuance will partially fund a stock buyback program, reducing the number of shares on the market, which often has the effect of lifting stock price by making shares scarcer. By buying back shares, Snowflake is aiming to support the stock price in the short term, potentially improving per-share earnings and appealing to investors.

So, why take on this debt if it’s going toward share buybacks? Snowflake’s move suggests they’re anticipating significant growth in the near future, likely from strong revenue and demand for their data cloud services. With the convertible notes carrying no interest payments, Snowflake doesn’t need to worry about traditional debt servicing costs. Investors instead receive an option to convert these notes into Snowflake stock, but only if the share price climbs to a level that makes the conversion profitable.

A key detail here is that these notes have a 40% conversion premium, meaning investors would only convert their notes to stock if Snowflake’s price rises significantly above current levels. If this happens, the notes convert into shares, giving Snowflake a financial cushion now without immediate dilution for existing shareholders. They also implemented a capped call transaction to reduce the risk of dilution even if the stock does convert later on.

Essentially, this move aligns with a high-confidence outlook from Snowflake’s management. They seem to believe they’ll perform well enough in the short term to drive up their stock price and make this financing favorable for the company. This strategy could provide Snowflake with more flexibility for acquisitions, product investment, and even future stock or debt issuances at more favorable terms if their market valuation continues to rise.

While it’s a bold move, it’s not without risk. If Snowflake’s growth doesn’t match expectations, they’ll have taken on significant debt without the offsetting benefit of a higher stock price. But the confidence expressed in their growth trajectory—particularly in a competitive data market—is telling, and if they can execute their strategy effectively, this could be a smart way to support their stock while preparing for further expansion.",17,20,1730585326.0
Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.

Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

Questions on trading and trailing stop losses,"I use 2 different brokerage companies and have a single brokerage account with the first company (Robinhood) and I have a ROTH IRA and a brokerage account with the second company (Charles Schwab). 

I have finally been able to stuff over $25k into the Schwab brokerage account. Currently I have about $17k in stocks or ETFs and the remaining $8k in cash. I'm not going to start day trading until my transfer of $2k goes in so I have $27k and never have to worry about going below $25k again. My plan is to day trade a lot with this Schwab brokerage account and you all are probably aware to do unlimited day trades you need $25k in that single account. I read somewhere recently and I do not know how accurate it was that now you also need $25k in margin to be able to do unlimited day trades? 

Will slapping tight trailing stop losses on all stocks and ETFs affect day trading capabilities for other securities? 

And is there anything I need to be aware of going past the $25k mark and being able to now day trade all the time instead of the 3 allowed in a 5 day period?",1,4,1730565261.0

Etsy's declining gross merchandising sales - from a buyer,"Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.

I can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.

I buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.

I started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.

Anyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.

Last Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.

The next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.

As it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!

I contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.

Most buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.

Sellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.

For 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.

I have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?

And accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.

I can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.

Don't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.

The moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.

Etsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",73,28,1730509574.0

"Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing Intel","Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that replaces a flagging semiconductor company with the primary vendor of GPUs for AI.

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. In a separate move, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc in the average as well, S&P Global said in a statement.

Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180% so far in 2024 as investors have seen the company as the primary beneficiary of the AI boom.

On the other hand, Intel shares have fallen 51% so far this year as the company struggles with manufacturing, new competition for its central processors, and the impression that it has missed out on the AI trend.

The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of the companies total market value.

Thoughts on IONQ and SLI?,"Here's my analysis on IONQ

IonQ, Inc. (NYSE: IONQ) is a prominent player in the quantum computing industry, specializing in trapped-ion technology. This approach offers advantages in coherence time and error rates, positioning IonQ at the forefront of quantum computing advancements.

Key Factors Supporting IonQ's Investment Potential:

2. Strategic Partnerships and Contracts: The company has secured substantial contracts, including a $54.5 million agreement with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab in September 2024 to advance quantum networking and system scalability. 


3. Financial Performance: IonQ has shown robust financial growth. In Q2 2024, the company reported $11.4 million in revenue, exceeding the high end of its guidance range and representing a 106% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. 


4. Strong Cash Position: As of June 30, 2024, IonQ maintained $402 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, providing a solid foundation for ongoing research, development, and expansion initiatives. 



Revenue from the Last Earnings Call:

During the second quarter of 2024, IonQ reported revenue of $11.4 million, surpassing its projected range of $7.6 million to $9.2 million. This performance underscores the company's accelerating growth trajectory and its ability to exceed financial expectations. 

IonQ's combination of technological innovation, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and a solid cash position contributes to its potential as a compelling investment opportunity in the emerging quantum computing sector.

Two potential undervalued gems - DLTR & DG,"I've been evaluating as most here the horrible jobs report and seeing the mag 7 flutter.. it made me investigate some tickers which have fell from grace.

Two that really caught my eye were Dollar Tree(DLTR) & Dollar General (DG).. 

Both are essential 52 week lows and fell 50% from highs and couple of months ago. You may ask, why? Well a couple of factors. Earnings weren't so hot. Mainly from eeconomic headwinds.. margin compression, and competition from the likes of walmart.

Individually each has a weakness in their own right. DG typically looking ratchet and prices higher than others. DLTR with their recent purchase of family dollar not working as well as they'd like.

Now, why are these potentially a awesome place to park your money? 

First off, much cheaper than just a few months ago. 2nd and most likely the catalyst.. a economic recession. 

We are getting closer to one as each day passes. We all saw the jobs report this morn. I feel like the lack of sales stems from the poor getting to poor to shop there but as a recession looms we will see the pivot from those who went to target supermarket to a dollar store.

BlackRock launches ETF that expands beyond the ‘Magnificent Seven’,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/megacap-tech-gets-new-blackrock-etf.html


> BlackRock’s iShares is trying to appeal to investors who want to diversify beyond from the so-called Magnificent Seven. The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn’t just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It’s made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. “What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner,” BlackRock’s Rachel Aguirre told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.

> Aguirre, the firm’s head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF’s mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – “whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500].” The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500.

> On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That’s equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% “It’s important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win,” Aguirre said. “There’s also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it’s actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations.”",145,62,1730466592.0
"U.S. economy added 12,000 jobs in October, far less than expected; unemployment rate at 4.1%","**U.S. economy added 12,000 jobs in October, far less than expected; unemployment rate at 4.1%**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html)

&#x200B;

*Job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020 as the impacts of storms in the Southeast and a significant labor impasse dented the employment picture.*

*Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 for the month, down sharply from September and below the Dow Jones estimate for 100,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. In what had already been expected to be a downbeat report, October posted the smallest gain since December 2020.*

*The unemployment rate, however, held at 4.1%, in line with expectations. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.7%.*

*In the report narrative, the BLS noted that the Boeing strike likely subtracted 44,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, which lost 46,000 positions overall.*

&#x200B;

*Along with that, the report noted the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton but said “it is not possible to quantify the net effect” of the storms on the jobs total.*

*Elsewhere, the bureau said average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, slightly higher than the estimate, though the 4% 12-month gain was in line. The average work week held steady at 34.3 hours.*

*Markets, though, largely ignored the bad news, with stock market futures poised for a strong open on Wall Street while Treasury yields plunged. The meager jobs numbers along with wages about in line with expectations help cement another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.*

&#x200B;

*The release comes just days ahead of the presidential election in which Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in what most polls show to be a deadlocked race. With the economy at the forefront of the battle, the light jobs number “casts a murky shadow heading into next week,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.*

*The weak October report also included substantial downward revisions from previous months. August was cut to just a gain of 78,000 while September’s initial estimate came down to 223,000. Together, the net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals by 112,000.*

&#x200B;

*Health care and government again led job creation, respectively adding 52,000 and 40,000 positions. Several sectors, though, saw job losses.*

*In addition to the expected pullback in manufacturing, temporary help services saw a drop of 49,000. The category is sometimes seen as a proxy for underlying job strength and has seen a decline of 577,000 since March 2022, the BLS said.*

*Another leading sector, leisure and hospitality, saw a drop of 4,000, while retail trade and transportation and warehousing also reported modest declines.*

*The report covers a month in which hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeast – Florida and North Carolina in particular – while the Boeing strike also hit what had been a vibrant though slowing labor market. Recent developments indicate that the Boeing impasse, which sidelined some 44,000 workers, could be near an end.*

*Prior to the release, job creation had averaged close to 200,000 a month during 2024, about 60,000 below the pace for the same period a year ago through still indicative of solid pace of hiring.*

*Some cracks in recent months have raised concerns at the Federal Reserve that while the year-over-year pace of inflation is slowing, elevated interest rate could impact the labor market and threaten the ongoing economic expansion.*

*As a result, policymakers in September took a step unprecedented for a growing economy and lowered their benchmark short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, double the customary quarter-point increments in which the Fed usually likes to move.*

*Financial markets are pricing in a strong likelihood that the central bank cuts by a quarter point at each of its two remaining meetings this year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision next Thursday.*",927,152,1730464515.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

“I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business,” Jassy said. “We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.”

Amazon spent $22.6 billion on property and equipment during the quarter, up 81% from the year before. Jassy said Amazon plans to spend $75 billion on capex in 2024 and expects an even higher number in 2025.

The jump in spending is primarily being driven by generative AI investments, Jassy said. The company is rushing to invest in data centers, networking gear and hardware to meet vast demand for the technology, which has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its ChatGPT assistant almost two years ago.

“It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” Jassy said. “And I think our customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term that we’re aggressively pursuing it.”

AI spending was a big topic on tech earnings calls this week. Meta on Wednesday raised its capital expenditures guidance, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was “quite happy” with the team’s execution. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI weighed on its fiscal first-quarter earnings released on Wednesday, and the company said capital spending would continue to rise. A day earlier, Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi warned the company expects capital spending to grow in 2025.

Amazon has said its cloud unit has picked up more business from companies that need infrastructure to deploy generative AI models. It’s also launched several AI products for enterprises, third-party sellers on its marketplace and advertisers in recent months. The company is expected to announce a souped-up version of its Alexa voice assistant that incorporates generative AI, something Jassy said will arrive “in the near future.”

Amazon hasn’t disclosed its revenue from generative AI, but Jassy said Thursday it’s become a “multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate” business within AWS that “continues to grow at a triple-digit year-over-year percentage.”

“It’s growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew, and we felt like AWS grew pretty quickly,” he added.

"Coinbase drops 15% after earnings, posts worst day in more than two years","Coinbase shares were under pressure Thursday, a day after the company reported weaker-than-expected earnings and gave a tepid revenue outlook for the current quarter.

The stock lost 15.3%, its biggest drop since May 2022, when it fell 19.5%. A broader market decline also pressured Coinbase.

Other crypto-related stocks fell as well. Robinhood, which also reported weak earnings Wednesday, tumbled 16%. Miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms slid 8% and 11%, respectively.

Bitcoin, which is often a big influence on the price of Coinbase, slid 2.78% to $69,918.66 after hovering below its all-time high of $73,000 this week.

Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, chalked it up to a temporary unwind in crypto-related names and called it an opportunity for longer-term focused investors in Coinbase and Robinhood.

“There is a lot that’s going to happen here over the next couple months – \[like\] the U.S. election \[and\] ramifications of that – that will be become the much bigger story for the space, not to mention the recent appreciation in crypto prices and volume could put upward pressure on fourth-quarter revenue if the trend continues over the next two months,” said Ryan, who has an outperform rating on Coinbase.

“Near-term, people will have to recalibrate a bit in their models for the blended take rate assumption,” or the percentage of revenue Coinbase keeps from a transaction, he said. “Nothing structural occurred here, but as stablecoin trading volume has increased, that comes at a lower spread, and the fourth-quarter implied revenue guide was a bit soft.”

Owen Lau, an analyst at Oppenheimer with a buy rating on Coinbase, put Thursday’s drop on the warning that subdued volume could persist going forward and that lower U.S. interest rates could cut into the growth of Coinbase’s stablecoin revenue.

"The S&P 500 And The Nasdaq Composite With Losses Of 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively,Could Be Headed For A Small Correction.","The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were in a free fall today losing 1.9% and 2.8% respectively, - a rout as traders and investors turned their noses up at Meta and Microsoft’s earnings. Even Google has given up its 5% gain from yesterday. Matching the drop, the VIX closed at 23.16, and the 10-year Treasury Yield closed about the same at 4.29%. 

Should Apple and Amazon disappoint post-market today, I think a correction could be on. The main bullish factor countering a volatile election week, a VIX over 23 and high yields of 4.3% is strong earnings, especially from the M-7. Clearly, that doesn’t seem to be happening.

Meta  - Initially, it seemed like a perfunctory one percent drop on a small beat and in-line guidance, but it’s gone a lot further as Meta is down 4% to 570.

**Why the rout?** Analysts and investors panned high Capex plans of $40Bn and costly high-risk bets such as Meta’s Reality Labs unit, (the developer of augmented and virtual reality technologies), which logged a staggering operating loss of $4.4 billion 

Microsoft - (down 6% to $408) is getting clobbered for a different reason. Even as Azure grew 34%, the pace wasn’t enough, and guidance of 31% to 32% in constant currency was lower than expected. However, this is due to supply chain constraints as President Amy Hood noted that the 1 or 2-point deceleration Microsoft has guided is mainly due to some supply pushouts, in terms of AI supply coming online that the company counted on. (Read, not as many Blackwells/Hoppers as they would have liked)

""We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history,"" Hood added.

The indomitable Dan Ives of Wedbush remains as bullish as ever…

""We actually disagree with this initial take as the new Azure reporting standards have moved Street numbers all around and a slight deceleration is totally expected by many investors with some supply constraints and reacceleration in 2H25, and we would be strong buyers of MSFT on any weakness this morning,"" Wedbush analysts, led by Daniel Ives, said in a note.",0,14,1730408821.0

"Intel shares pop 12% on earnings beat, uplifting guidance","Intel shares jumped 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected revenue and issued quarterly guidance that topped expectations.

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:

* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted
* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected

Intel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

As part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.

Intel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.

CNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.

The Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.

Revenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.

Intel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.

During the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.

As of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.

ENVX: why I like the stock,"ENVX and why it will moon

ENVX (Enovix) is an advanced lithium-ion silicon battery manufacturer, and is a first mover with it's battery. They already have 2 smartphone OEMs lined up for 2025, and they just finished their fab2 in Malaysia. They have a patent to protect their proprietary process behind their silicon batteries. They are the first to use 100% active silicon batteries in the consumer market. Competitors cannot just spin up a fab easily.

They are positioned to ramp up production in 2025 with profits coming in early 2026.

They recently raised $100m via stockholder dilution, out of their 168m total outstanding shares. This is roughly only 6% dilution. As of today, their share price has dropped 19%. The $100m dilution along with $200m cash on hand, allows them to survive for 6 more quarters at a minimum, assuming they still continue to burn $50m in cash per quarter, without *any* efficiency gains. That positions that well for the beginning of 2026 play. More partnerships, more customers, lower CAPEX, different segments of customers, will all drive the price up. 

Next-gen batteries and EVs and component manufacturers are a long-term play

I believe ENVX is currently underpriced. As of current price $8.45, my EOY price target is $12, and by end of next year, I see $18 at a minimum.",11,21,1730395379.0
Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

Comcast is exploring separation of cable business,"Comcast is exploring a separation of its cable networks business, President Mike Cavanagh said Thursday.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call with investors, Cavanagh said the company is exploring creating “a new, well-capitalized company owned by our shareholders and comprised of our strong portfolio of cable networks.”

The possible separation would not include broadcast network NBC nor streaming service Peacock, he added. NBCUniversal’s cable networks portfolio includes Bravo, E!, Syfy, Oxygen True Crime, USA Network, as well as news networks MSNBC and CNBC.

The company lost 365,000 cable TV customers during the third quarter.

“Like many of our peers in media, we are experiencing the effects of the transition in our video businesses and have been studying the best path forward for these assets,” Cavanagh said.

“We are not ready to talk about any specifics yet, but we’ll be back to you as and when we reach firm conclusions,” he said.

Shares of Comcast were up more than 6% in premarket trading.

The comments come as millions of customers continue to flee the traditional pay TV bundle in favor of streaming. Comcast has been beefing up Peacock, which got a boost during the third quarter when it exclusively aired the Summer Olympics in Paris.

$UBER is positioned extremely well for the future,"At the time of writing this post, UBER is down 7% in premarket, which is a big overreaction, after their earnings report. I suspect the cause of the drop is the miss on Bookings, which is not significant in my opinion.

Key factors:

- EPS of $1.20, beating expectations of $0.41

- Revenue of $11.2B, beating expectations of $11B

- Total Gross Bookings of $41B, missing expectations of $43B

UBER had a record quarter, for the first time it generated an all time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1B.

In the conference call the CEO and CFO reiterated that they have a very high standard for doing M&A, so the Expedia deal is not set in stone, rather just a rumor.

They've also stated they are looking to reduce share count in 2025, meaning doing share buybacks, which will in turn drive higher share price.

But what I want to talk mostly about is the AV section.

**AV**

The AV (Autonomous vehicle or self driving cars) is a hot topic right now, especially after Teslas event. Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?

They are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.

I think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year.

**Price Target $122 after oral wight loss data by Raymond James, speculation buyout target $150/share ($20 Billion Valuation)**

**TL;DR** = Right now the market leaders in weight loss are $LLY and $NVO with injectable needles. $VKTX is also in this delivery mechanism, but showing better safety in their phase 2a data and got FDA approval to go straight to Phase 3 trails and skipping Phase 2b which is huge news.

**Oral Data Catalyst** \- Nobody likes taking weekly injectables, so an ""oral pill"" is seen as a gamechanger. Weight loss over 5% is a very competitive number and **over 6% will be home run**. This is a 28 day trial and not 13 weeks. Pay attention to **efficacy and safety of VK2735**.

**M&A Buyout** \- There are big pharma companies out there who are not in the weight loss space yet such as Merck $MRK and their **$25 billion drug Keytruda going off patent in 2028**. $MRK needs to shore up a big revenue source soon and the **wight loss drug category is poised to reach $471 Billion by 2032.**

Keep in mind $VKTX 2735 showed 3.3% weight loss at 40mg and safety profile similar to Placebo. However, Nov 3rd will show results from high dose cohorts **60mg, 80mg and 100mg**.

**$LLY** Orforglipron showed 3% weight loss, \~ 28% vomiting. 39% Nausea

**$NVO** two oral drugs

1. Monlunabant- I personally don't see a path for this drug. 3.3% weight loss in 28 days but here comes the safety hammer with drug showing psychiatric issues like anxiety, irritability, and sleep disturbances won't go well with FDA. $SNY drug rimonabant (never got approved) because drug was plagued with CNS issues
2. Amycretin- Weight loss around 4% (don't have the exact number) but safety profile is as worse as CT-996. Nause 75%, Vomiting 56%, diarrhea 18.8%.

**Conclusion:** For $VKTX the bar is to show weight loss 5-6% or higher to beat competitors and stay competitive with tolerability profile. In my opinion, higher doses will show weight loss > 6% with competitive edge on safety.",19,24,1730380000.0

* PCE MoM is 0.2% vs 0.2% Expected
* FOMC focuses on PCE inflation in its quarterly economic projections and states its longer-run inflation goal in terms of headline PCE. PCE inflation has been preferred over CPI since 2000 for three main reasons:

1. The expenditure weights in the PCE can change as people substitute away from some goods and services for others
2. PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services
3. Historical PCE data can be revised more than for seasonal factors only

* There is a 94.6% chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut in November as of this morning after the PCE report, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That would bring the target federal funds rate down to a range of 4.50%-4.75%.

      * This interview made me think about Big Bear Ai recent contract and the existing partnership between the two companies. Big Bear breaking into the defense sphere recently puts them on the map, and more such contracts are expected, No to mention the numerous airports and boat terminals that adopt BBAI technology.

====================================

* BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI) has been awarded a **five-year, $165.15 million sole source prime contract** by the U.S. Army for Global Force Information Management (GFIM) Production Services. This contract builds on BigBear.ai's ongoing work since 2021 to transform 15 legacy systems into an enterprise-wide intelligent automation platform, supporting the Army's vision for data-centric force management. The primary objective is to deliver a **dynamic, integrated, and interoperable transactional global force structure and employment data system** for the force management community. Upon completion, GFIM-OE will enable senior leaders and combatant commanders to make data-driven force structure decisions more quickly and with greater confidence, ensuring the Army is properly manned, equipped, trained, and resourced.
   * Five-year contract duration provides stable revenue stream
   * Sole source prime contractor status for the project
   * Continuation and expansion of existing partnership with the Army
   * Opportunity to contribute to critical military force management systems

===========================================

* BBAI being connected to Palantir, I like. Especially because Palantir CEO is obsessed with defense. (See Bill Maher Real Time Interview)

Capcom might benefit hugely from its next release,"*Disclaimer: Capcom is my biggest position and has been for a while. I am a Monster Hunter fan. I usually just write about video games and have little financial insight. My video game insight might be useful, though.*

Capcom is a Japanese video game company that has been doing quite well lately. You might know them for games such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, Mega Man and Monster Hunter. That last series is the reason I'm writing this up.

Capcom just released its financial results for the first half of the year and they don't look too great. This was 100% expected as their new releases were thin, but the stock price is still down. However, the next entry to Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Wilds (MHWi), is coming in February and I don't think it is properly priced in.

Monster Hunter is secretly huge. People into video games know about it and know it is big of course, but I feel they don't exactly appreciate how big. Monster Hunter World (MHWo) (the ""prequel"" to Wilds) sold 27 million units, those are Call of Duty numbers. You can bring that to 41million units if you count the full price expansion that followed a year later. Capcom still sold 3million+ units of MHWo (base game + expansion) in FY24. As of writing this, MHWo is the 23rd most played game on Steam, that is above games such as Elden Ring and Destiny 2 which both had big expansions this very year. It 's barely below Baldur's Gate 3, which released last year. MHWo came out in 2018 (2019 for the expansion).

MHWi will be the first Monster Hunter game to release on Steam on the same day as consoles, I believe this will generate surprisingly huge numbers. These numbers are made public on Steam and help generate a ton of hype. Media outlets just adore writing about player numbers. I fully believe MHWi will have a hype cycle similar to Helldivers 2 or Palworld this year, maybe not quite as strong as Wukong, though. This will establish Monster Hunter as a big mainstream franchise.

As opposed to Helldivers, Palworld or Wukong, there's actually a stock to go and buy during the hype cycle. I'm betting on people throwing money at Capcom.

**Why write this now?**

As I said, the stock is down, so there's a nice little window here. It might go down further before February, though.

There's a beta for MHWi going on right now. I played the game, it's a little bit rough, but I can at least attest that there are no major issues. Reception has been pretty good.

The beta was on PS5 until now and it opens to Steam and Xbox later today, we will have a first glimpse at the Steam numbers. I wanted to write this before we know those numbers in case in unexpectedly blows up. The beta is quite limited, so most players won't spend hours and hours on it, which limits player counts. I don't think it'll blow up, but there a small chance it breaks top 10 on Steam. Any more than that and MHWi is a guaranteed mega-hit.

**Risks:**

Gaming communities have become quite finicky and can turn on games in a dime. We saw this earlier this year with Dragon's Dogma 2 also from Capcom. It suffered a lot of bad press because of bad graphics performance, dumb DLC and some misunderstanding. It still sold rather well, but it could have done much more, in my opinion.

MHWi *will* have questionable performance (not as bad as DD2 and it won't be a bad surprise because we can run it ourselves in the beta) and it *will* have some dumb DLC. Now it's a matter of seeing if gaming communities decide to latch on to it or not.

**Bonus:**

Capcom also makes Resident Evil games which have been very popular. There might be an announcement of the next one rather soon, which might have an effect on the stock price.

**TLDR;**

Monster Hunter Wilds is releasing on February 28th:

1. It will be selling more than expected
2. The hype will propulse the stock even higher

Dropbox - The outsider with a sticky product,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.

It had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.

The freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).



**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**

A crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**

***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***

Cloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.

Moreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.

***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***

For many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.



**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**

It is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.

You’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.

However, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**

Don’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.

The competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***



**4.0 The past acquisitions**

The company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:

* **July 2012, TapEngage** \- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*
* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*
* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \- *a company allowing users to ""aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*
* **July 2013, Endorse** \- *a mobile coupon startup.*
* **April 2014, Loom** \- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*
* **April 2014, Hackpad** \- *a document-sharing startup*
* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*
* **January 2015, CloudOn** \- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*
* **January 2019, HelloSign** \- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***
* **March 2021, DocSend** \- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*
* **October 2021, Command E** \- universal search company
* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*
* **December 2022, FormSwift** \- *form management platform*



There have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.



**5.0 The financials**

If you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

The revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.

The operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).

A lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.

From 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.

So, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \~20% since becoming a public company.

Based on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.

  
**6.0 The valuation**

How does one value a company of this kind?

It has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.

Except, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**

Inputs:

Free cash flow - SBC of $450m.

Growth in perpetuity of 4%.

Discount rate of 8%.

Adjusting for cash/debt

The value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.

  
**7.0 My thoughts**

A company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \~8% long-term yield seems fair.

I don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.

The only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.

"Dropbox slashes 20% of global workforce, eliminating more than 500 roles","Dropbox is laying off 20% of its global workforce, the equivalent of 528 roles, CEO Drew Houston announced Wednesday in a note to staff.

The company is in a ""transitional period"" as its file sync and share business and its Dash artificial-intelligence search feature mature, Houston wrote.

""Navigating this transition while maintaining our current structure and investment levels is no longer sustainable,"" he said in his note.

The move follows a 16% cut to Dropbox's workforce in April 2023, which affected 500 staffers. At the time, Houston wrote that the cuts were due to slowing growth, economic headwinds and the need to invest more resources and head count into the increasingly competitive AI race.

Dropbox will be making cuts to the parts of its business where the company is ""over-invested or underperforming"" while working toward a ""flatter, more efficient"" team structure, Houston wrote.

""We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business,"" Houston wrote. ""But external factors are only part of the story. We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.""

Affected employees will receive 16 weeks of pay, starting Wednesday, with one additional week of pay for each completed tenure year at the company.

Starbucks CEO pledges to fundamentally change strategy as sales fall for third straight quarter,"Starbucks on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as sales in the U.S. and China, its two biggest markets, disappointed.

The company previously released a preliminary report of its quarterly results on Oct. 22 and announced it was suspending its fiscal 2025 outlook. 

This report marks the first under CEO Brian Niccol, who joined the company on Sept. 9 to revive the floundering business. 

“It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers,” CEO Brian Niccol said in a statement. “We have a clear plan and are moving quickly to return Starbucks to growth.”

Investors are expecting that Niccol will share more details about his turnaround strategy during the company’s conference call, scheduled for 5 p.m. ET.

Shares of the company fell 1% in extended trading on Wednesday.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 80 cents vs. $1.03 expected

Revenue: $9.07 billion vs. $9.36 billion expected

Starbucks reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $909.3 million, or 80 cents per share, down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales dropped 3% to $9.07 billion. 

The company’s global same-store sales fell 7%, fueled by weak demand in the U.S. and China. Traffic to its stores worldwide fell 8% during the quarter.

The company’s U.S. restaurants reported same-store sales declines of 6%, fueled by a 10% tumble in traffic.

In China, the company’s same-store sales plummeted 14% as both traffic and average ticket fell. Starbucks has been facing greater competition from local rivals, like Luckin Coffee, which can undercut the company’s prices.

"Visa plans to fire 1,400 employees and contractors","Multinational payment card services corporation Visa has been planning to lay off nearly 1,400 employees and contractors by the end of 2024. 

According to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visa’s merchant sales and global digital partnership roles.

The report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited by Reuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands.

Visa’s legal issues

Recently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, in September 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network.

Moreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visa’s conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.

Recent CROX stock drop,"Hello all, 

I've been watching this stock for a little while now and with the most recent quarter announcement the stock dropped 16%. This seems to be because of the earnings of their ""heydude"" brand. 

Just wanted to get some opinions and general discussion on it. Is now a time to buy or do you think it's gonna drop more? Anyone here actually owned a pair of heydude shoes? Did anyone see this happening?

Why SMCI's situation is a massive threat to Nvidia,"SMCI has faced allegations of accounting manipulation, which have escalated this morning when it was revealed that their auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The true extent of the situation is not yet known to the public

SMCI is one of Nvidia's largest customers, accounting for 9% of their sales. If they go under, Nvidia will take a massive hit to their future earnings.

Some may argue that it does not matter, because since Nvidia's production is sold out, any gap in orders would be filled by other customers. There are 2 problems with this assumption:

1. This ignores the impact of a hypothetical liquidation of SMCI. If SMCI was faking orders, this would mean that they likely have a growing inventory of AI chips. These would then be auctioned off, creating a surge in supply, competing with new orders.

2. The duration of Nvidia's lead times can impact their margins and pricing power. If you have a 12 month lead time due to immense demand, you can hike prices. If that lead time shrinks to 1 month due to losing a significant customer, you have less margin to raise prices without impacting sales.

This scandal could also draw attention to other ""round tripping"" arrangements in the tech industry, in which circular transactions are set up in order to fake revenue growth. This could very much be the start of the unraveling of a bubble.

This isn't going to bankrupt Nvidia, they still have incredibly successful products and other customers, but it could definitely lead to a case where earnings growth stagnates, or is not sufficient enough to justify their current share price.

Despite this tremendous threat, Nvidia is down just 1% today, which is well within its normal volatility. The market is not responding to this new information appropriately.",3,90,1730305479.0

Who wins btwn NVO vs LLY in the Weightloss Market,"Because of what I’ll talk about below I don’t include things like ALT or Viking therapeutics. In the long term their best plays feel like they lean more towards acquisition. 

It feels like we’re getting too bogged down on which drug performs marginally better when we look at weight loss drugs. It feels irrelevant to the fundamental assumptions baked into growth forecasts which is that there would be a wider adoption of the treatment. 

At the end of the day the semantics of x% weight loss on drug A vs y% on drug B only matter so much. I think what is really going to decide who wins this competition and who grows their market share is whoever is able to more materially lower their prices.

As income decreases obesity rates increase. As an example only 29% of women with incomes 350% above the poverty level are obese vs 42% of those that are 130% below the poverty level. There’s also a much broader market if you were to include a lower income groups. So having less access to more expensive and healthier foods means higher rates of obesity, this makes sense.

Frankly, I don’t think people in lower income groups care about which one is marginally better, they want something they can afford. And both NVO and LLY have such massive barriers to broadening their market because of their exorbitant pricing. There is a clear disconnect between variables that might increase the rate of someone having the ailment these companies want to treat, and the prices they sell these treatments for.

Wanted to wait until LLYs earnings came out today to see if this is an industry trend or not. And what I described above feels like it ties to what we’re seeing performance wise. Both LLY in its earnings today and NVO last quarter (and likely this quarter) had more substantial sales misses and changes to forward looking forecasts. 

To me this feel less like Competitor A selling more than Competitor B and moreso an industry wide forecast miss. And this forecast miss is because they assumed the market would grow more substantially by now, but I think they’re hitting a point where growth is slowing because the LARGER bucket of their addressable market really can’t afford their treatments at their current prices. 

So in the long run for a drug that treats ailments such as Ozempic or Zepbound it feels like this will be less of a race over which drug performs better and more towards which drug people can actually afford. As a result I think both NVO and LLY will decline in share price and performance until they figure this out. What’s everyone else’s thoughts? ",17,24,1730303976.0

CEO: ""This is why you often hear me say, it's a matter of when, but not if we'll become a Top 10 institution""

* I could not be prouder of how we've scaled this segment over the past five years since launching these products through a tumultuous and unpredictable environment to now be a $1 billion annualized revenue business growing over 100% with strong and improving profitability. And frankly, it's still day one.
* We continue to see a strong pipeline of potential partners that are striving to modernize their platforms.
* Our one-stop shop continues to attract great cross-buying behavior by our members. In fact, 32% of new products were opened by existing SoFi members and 20% of our new members opened a second product in their first 30 days. This is the power of the flywheel we have developed.
* Overall, we're making incredible progress in our shift towards more fee-based, capital-light and lower-risk revenue sources. Combined, fee-based revenue made up $174 million or a quarter of our adjusted net revenue in Q3. This revenue grew by 65% year-over-year. On an annualized basis, that's nearly $700 million in revenue.
* We've achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student lender finance only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood.
* Our performance in the hard times is what gives me the strong confidence in our future. Today, we faced fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy.
* We continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. 
* We continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. 
* We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs.
* SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier and our beta testing a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months.
* In credit cards, we officially launched the everyday cash rewards and the essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people spending and borrowing needs,
* We shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue.
* We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years.
* Home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022.
* In our tech platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks in Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyber Bancorp for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsored bank program.
* We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galileo instant verification engine, which we call GIVE as well as transaction risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency. Our new secured credit with dynamic funding offering promotes greater financial inclusion and enables clients to help their customers build stronger credit.
* We launched programs with clients signed in prior quarters, spanning cross-border payments, global payouts, financial literacy, and scalable payment solutions.
* Delinquencies peaked in March of 2024. Since then, we've continued to see improvements quarter-over-quarter.
* In closing, I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished not just for Q3, but for delivering a steady and consistent record of durable growth, incredible brand building and product innovation that help our members and clients and strong improving returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and I am fired up for what in store.
* We reduced our brokered deposits by $445 million as we continue to use our consumer deposits to replace higher cost parts of the funding stack.
* SoFi Money continues to resonate well, maintaining market share and ranking in API. We saw over $2 billion in member deposit growth in the quarter, with spending levels on par or better than historical levels. Direct deposit customers are more engaged, with higher product adoption, contributing to our competitive advantage.
* We declined between 70% and 80% of the personal loan applicants to SoFi. And so there's a lot of potential
* His closing statement: We now face hopefully, the most advantageous environment that we've seen since I joined the company, and we began the relentless march to be a one-stop shop. Today, we are no longer just a lending company. Today, we are a force to be reckoned with. It is truly our time as we have more products, more members, more capital and more diverse revenue streams than ever before. We are undeniably the absolute best patient company to capture the massive opportunities still ahead of us because of the same thing that got us here, our people. Our people are great at heart. Thank you, everyone, for your time today, and we hope you have a great end to 2024.

CFO:

* Loan Platform Deals: CFO: This is a fee-based and capital-light revenue source for us. We generate cash fees upfront at the time of transfer or referral without taking balance sheet risk. Importantly, there are no financing commitments or loss share agreements associated with these deals.
* There is a 220 basis points difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base.
* We expect modest growth in balance sheet originations year-over-year. We are happy with the current size of our balance sheet and the net interest income generated. Excess demand from borrowers and loan investors is being fulfilled through our loan platform business. We expect growth in student loan refinancing and home loans in a lower rate environment.
* Recent (loan) vintages are projected to produce higher returns, with ROEs above 30%. This is driven by lower expected life of loan loss rates, higher pricing beta, funding cost efficiencies, and origination fees.
* We expect continued strong growth in the loan platform business, with commitments from Fortress and other partners. Demand is strong, and we are fulfilling it through the loan platform business.
* For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels.
* Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and tech platform will grow low to upper teens percent year-over-year.
* GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.

Volkswagen profit plunges 42% in third quarter amid sweeping overhaul plans,"German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.

Operating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.

Vehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.

Net liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company’s net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.

Volkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.

Volkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.

Arno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a “challenging market environment” and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.

The third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.

Volkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.

On Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company’s management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.

In response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.

“Ahead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,” Volkswagen’s chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.

He added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.

Meiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.

*On October 24, 2024, Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) sent the members of the Audit Committee a letter of resignation as the Company’s registered public accounting firm (the “Resignation Letter”).*  
  
*The Chair of the Audit Committee discussed with EY the reasons for EY’s resignation. The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*  
  
*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*  
  
*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*  
  
*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*  
  
*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*  
  
*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*  
  
*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*",551,141,1730293730.0

Apparently that's a $20decillion, fine.

  
Google banned the ultra-nationalist Tsargrad channel from YouTube in 2020, in response to US sanctions imposed against its owner, but after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 more channels were added to the banned list. 

The court imposed a 100,000 rubles per day, equivalent to about $1,025, with the total fine doubling every week. Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‘a case in which there are many, many zeroes’. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.

In its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‘We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‘For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.

"US economy grew 2.8% in third quarter, far outpacing expectations of 2.6%","
The U.S. economy expanded at a healthy pace during the third quarter, keeping fears of a downturn at bay while Federal Reserve officials eye further interest-rate cuts.

Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the three months ended in September, according to the first estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The consensus call among economists surveyed by FactSet was for growth of 2.6% in the third quarter, though Bloomberg's forecast was for 2.9%.  

Wednesday's solid third-quarter growth comes after real GDP growth was 3% during the second quarter and 1.6% during the first three months of the year.

While GDP is a fundamental economic measure, most economists and analysts believe Federal Reserve officials will use inflation and employment data as more of a guide when weighing their interest-rate policy decision at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

"Where does ""liquidity"" come from?","We often hear financial markets are going up because of increased liquidity, and that stocks are up for no reason other than rising liquidity. In other instances we hear assets are dropping because the liquidity cycle just peaked. 

What is this liquidity we are talking about here and where does it all come from? Clearly there are many sources, but who are the main ones and how do they operate? 

The easiest one to point to is the Federal Reserve and its many QE (quantitative easing) programs. However, liquidity often rises even when the FED is running QT (quantitative tightening) as was the case in 2023.

Many point to the treasury as the hidden source of liquidity conducting a stealth QE of sort, but how do they do that? How do they manage to inject money into the stock market? 

Its clear they can do that directly to the economy by handing out stimulus checks and paying for new government projects, but that does not directly go to the market. 

How exactly does the treasury, FED and other sources add liquidity to the stock market to the point where assets start going up for no other reason?",0,27,1730288999.0
Eli Lilly stock tumbles 10% after missing estimates and slashing profit guidance,"Eli Lilly on Wednesday fell short of profit and revenue expectations for the third quarter and slashed its full-year adjusted profit guidance, sending its stock tumbling roughly 10%.

The drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $13.02 to $13.52 per share, down from previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.60 per share. 

Eli Lilly also lowered the high-end of its revenue outlook for the year and now expects sales of between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. The company’s previous guidance called for revenue of as much as $46.6 billion.

Here’s what Eli Lilly reported for the period ended September 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: 

* **Earnings per share:** $1.18 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected
* **Revenue:** $11.44 billion vs. $12.11 billion expected

Demand in the U.S. has far outpaced supply for Lilly’s incretin drugs, such as Zepbound and Mounjaro, over the last year. Both treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.

The popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its main rival, Novo Nordisk, to invest billions to increase manufacturing capacity for the treatments.

Eli Lilly’s supply woes began to ease earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration’s drug database said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Still, the agency warns that patients may not always be able to immediately fill their prescription for those drugs at a particular pharmacy.",123,55,1730286278.0

Anyone still rather buy Nike over Google?,"A month ago I posted a question asking why anyone would buy Nike when they can buy Google?  

I got a lot of apples and oranges responses.
I understand they are in different industries but a dollar is a dollar and I rather spend it on a stock with better value. Google is a way better company in every metric (even before today's earnings). 

I also got a lot of responses like ChatGpt will destroy search and Lina Khan will smash it into a million pieces.

Is there any proper analysis done on pfizers upcoming patent cliffs?,"Hello,

So pfizer reported their earnings yesterday and excluding covid products, their revenues grew in lower double digits. They haven't quantitatively addressed their upcoming patent cliffs and how they expect to offset those with new products.

Googling revealed that pharmas generally lose about 40-90% of their product revenues in the 1st year itself post patent expiration. I did some rough calculation and considering about 3 billion coming in from oncology products, growing at about 35% yoy, they will only cover about much less than 50% of the revenue losses due to patent expiration from 2026 onwards.

I'm not sure how accurate my numbers are but I reduced the revenue contribution of expiring patents by 40% yoy for 2026, 27, 28 and oncology contributions simply can't catch up. I know they have other products in pipeline, including oral GLP but I'm not sure how to account for that.

Can someone point me to more reading material on analysis or their analysis?

Thanks.",10,7,1730265281.0

It’s one of Warren buffets favorites, it pays a solid dividend that has steadily increased, and just look how the stock price has continued to rise like clockwork. It’s down 10% from its ATH, and seems like a solid entry point. Regardless of what it does in the next months, it’s a solid long term hold including the dividends.

Prediction: Apple is grossly priced compared to Microsoft,"Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. 

**Apple**

* Market cap: 3.6T
* Current P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6
* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits
* Earnings growth: Low double digits
* Net Margin: 25%

 **Microsoft**

* Market cap: 3.2T
* Microsoft P/E: \~36
* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8
* Historical revenue growth: 15%
* Earnings growth: 15-20%
* Net margin: 35%

Last week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a ""potential supercycle"" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.

In my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.

To me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.

Here’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!

Tl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft

P.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",355,175,1730234844.0
"Snap reports better-than-expected third-quarter results, issues light forecast","Snap reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, but issued light fourth-quarter guidance. The stock slipped in extended trading.

Here is how the company did:

* **Earnings per share:** 8 cents adjusted vs. 5 cents expected, according to LSEG
* **Revenue:** $1.37 billion vs. $1.36 billion expected, according to LSEG 
* **Global daily active users:** 443 million vs. 441 million expected, according to StreetAccount
* **Global average revenue per user:** $3.10 vs. $3.09 expected, according to StreetAccount

Snap said fourth-quarter sales will be between $1.51 billion and $1.56 billion. The midpoint of its guidance is $1.54 billion, which is below the average analyst estimate of $1.56 billion.

Snap said its adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be between $210 million and $260 million. The middle of the range is higher than analysts’ estimates of $230.7 million.

The company’s sales jumped 15% year over year in the third quarter while its net loss narrowed by 58% year over year in the third quarter to $153 million, compared to a net loss of $368 million a year prior.

The number of Snapchat+ paying subscribers is now at 12 million, the company said. That is up from the 11 million it reported in August. The company debuted its subscription service in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to experience exclusive and prerelease features for $3.99 a month.

Snap also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program on Tuesday.

“Our investments in AI and AR are powering new creative experiences for our community and driving innovation across our advertising platform, underpinning our long term growth opportunity,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a statement.

In September, Snap debuted the fifth generation of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses that people can wear to see digital imagery spliced into the physical world. The new Spectacles are only available to developers who must pay $99 a month for one year if they want to build AR apps for the glasses.

Shortly after Snap announced the new Spectacles, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed the social networking giant’s experimental AR glasses called Orion. Meta’s Orion AR glasses have generated enthusiasm from employees and the company plans to attract developers next year in prelude for an eventual consumer launch.

In a letter to investors, Snap discussed the importance that developers play for the company’s Spectacles and AR initiatives.

“We aspire to be the most developer-friendly platform in the world, and we are excited to offer our new generation of Spectacles to developers as an invitation and inspiration to create new experiences,” Snap said in the letter.

Reddit shares soar 16% on earnings beat and better-than-expected forecast,"Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.

Here’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:

* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents
* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected

Reddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.

Revenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.

The company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.

Average revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.

“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”

This is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.

Since last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.

The company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.

Huffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.

Chipotle misses revenue estimates as same-store sales growth disappoints,"Chipotle Mexican Grill on Tuesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite another quarter of higher traffic to its restaurants. 

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 27 cents adjusted vs. 25 cents expected

Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.82 billion expected

Chipotle reported third-quarter net income of $378.4 million, or 28 cents per share, up from $313.2 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 

The company’s food and beverage costs increased during the quarter, in part due to Chipotle’s decision to re-emphasize generous portions after social media-fueled backlash over the size of its burrito bowls this summer.

Excluding items, the company earned 27 cents per share.

Net sales climbed 13% to $2.79 billion. 

Same-store sales rose 6%, just shy of StreetAccount estimates of 6.3%. Traffic to restaurants increased 3.3% in the quarter, continuing the chain’s streak of bucking an overall slump in foot traffic across the industry. While many consumers have opted to eat out less, Chipotle has benefitted from having a wealthier customer base that’s willing to pay more for its burritos and bowls. 

During the third quarter, Chipotle brought back its popular smoked brisket for a limited time. It’s currently the most expensive protein, topping even the chain’s steak and beef barbacoa options.

Digital sales accounted for 34% of the chain’s quarterly food and beverage revenue.

The company opened 86 new locations during the quarter, 73 of which included a “Chipotlane” dedicated to online order pickup.

For the full year, Chipotle reiterated its outlook that same-store sales will grow by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. The company also anticipates that it will open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year.

Looking to 2025, Chipotle plans to open between 315 and 345 new locations. More than 80% of those restaurants will include a Chipotlane.

The earnings report marks the company’s first since CEO Brian Niccol departed to lead Starbucks’ turnaround. Chipotle’s board has tapped COO Scott Boatwright as the company’s interim chief executive.

"Microsoft's GitHub goes beyond OpenAI, welcomes AI models from Anthropic, Google","Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.

GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.

“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”

Microsoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.

OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.

The arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.

Developers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.

Many other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

In February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.

In the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.

“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.

Also on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.

And GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.

Once they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.

Apple announces new and smaller Mac Mini with first redesign since 2010,"Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.

Aside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.

The Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.

The Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.

One improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.

Apple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.

Apple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.

However, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. 

Apple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.

Apple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.

Softbank’s Son Says Nvidia Is Undervalued as Super AI Looms,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/softbank-s-son-says-nvidia-is-undervalued-as-super-ai-looms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/softbank-s-son-says-nvidia-is-undervalued-as-super-ai-looms)

“The future is much bigger,” Son said at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh on Tuesday. “Nvidia is just one example.”

Son said artificial superintelligence that’s 10,000 times more advanced than human intelligence will be developed by 2035. But he said hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be needed to make this a reality.

McDonald's reverses U.S. same-store sales declines in Q3; E. coli fallout looms,"McDonald’s on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts’ expectations as its U.S. restaurants reversed last quarter’s same-store sales decline.

However, investors are worried about another dent to U.S. sales fueled by a recent E. coli outbreak across 13 states linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers. As of Friday, 75 health cases have been tied to the outbreak, including one death of an older adult.

Health authorities have honed in on the burger’s slivered onions as the likely source, and McDonald’s has suspended its relationship with the supplier. Quarter Pounder burgers will return to affected restaurants on a rolling basis this week, sans slivered onions.

“While the situation appears to be contained, and though it didn’t affect Q3 numbers, it’s certainly an important development, which I know is on many of your minds,” CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors on the company’s earnings call, adding that McDonald’s was sorry and is committed to “making this right.”

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in premarket trading.

Here’s what the company reported for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.23 adjusted vs. $3.20 expected

Revenue: $6.87 billion vs. $6.82 billion expected

McDonald’s posted third-quarter net income of $2.26 billion, or $3.13 per share, down from $2.32 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding certain items, the fast-food giant earned $3.23 per share.

Net sales rose 3% to $6.87 billion.

The chain’s global same-store sales fell 1.5%, a more drastic decline than the 0.6% that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount estimates, and was weighed down by the company’s international markets. It’s the second straight quarter that the company’s same-store sales have fallen.

“While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance this year has fallen short of our expectations,” Kempczinski said.

U.S. same-store sales rose 0.3%, reversing last quarter’s same-store sales declines but still slightly weaker than the 0.5% increase predicted by StreetAccount estimates. Traffic to its U.S. restaurants was slightly negative, but the company credited its marketing and a $5 value meal launched in late June for the increase in sales.

Diners have pulled back their restaurant spending, leading McDonald’s and its rivals to lean into discounts and other marketing tricks to bring customers back to their restaurants. For example, in August, McDonald’s launched limited-time “Collector’s Edition” cups.

The company’s two international divisions both reported steeper declines in same-store sales compared with the prior quarter. The international operated markets segment, which includes France, Germany and Australia, saw same-store sales shrink 2.1%. The international developmental licensed markets division reported same-store sales declines of 3.5%, driven by weak demand in the Middle East and China.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, it’s unclear how the E. coli outbreak might affect U.S. sales, particularly as consumers have grown more picky about how to spend their money and where.

McDonald’s executives have taken steps to reassure customers that the company’s menu items are safe to eat, including pulling Quarter Pounder burgers from menus in the affected areas until its beef patties were cleared as the culprit.

Still, foot traffic to U.S. locations fell roughly 10% in the three days immediately following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announcement last Tuesday of the E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s, according to a research note from Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.

JPMorgan is suing customers accused of theft in viral 'infinite money glitch',"JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.

The bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.

A Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.

“On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant’s Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,” the bank said in the Texas filing. “After the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.”

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the “infinite money glitch,” though it hasn’t disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they’re still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq’s Global Financial Crime Report.

The infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.

Normally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.

Miami and California

The other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.

Most cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.

In each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn’t been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.

JPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers’ fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.

Criminal cases?

The lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won’t tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.

The civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.

“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”

Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants ,"The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.",40,20,1730135004.0

Robinhood jumps into election trading,"Upstart broker Robinhood is jumping into the prediction betting game, announcing Monday users can begin trading the 2024 presidential election that is eight days away.

Users can trade a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump contract starting Monday, said the company, as long as they meet certain criteria that include being a U.S. citizen. The trading is being offered through its Robinhood Derivatives unit and ForecastEx, which is operated by Interactive Brokers.

Robinhood jumps into a suddenly crowded politics prediction markets field that grew this month after platform Kalshi won a key ruling against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was seeking to stop the election outcome trading. The CFTC is appealing the ruling. Shortly after, Interactive Brokers launched various political contracts, including on the election.

The election markets have generated some controversary this year with some concerned about light volume allowing the markets to be skewed. International platform Polymarket said last week that a single French user was responsible for four accounts spending millions to buy the Trump contract. But Polymarket said an investigation found the trading was not manipulating the market.

“We believe event contracts give people a tool to engage in real-time decision-making, unlocking a new asset class that democratizes access to events as they unfold,” said Robinhood in a statement. For now, only the presidential election contracts will be available to trade on the system.

Odds and gambling platforms do not use methodologies used by traditional political polling, and therefore are not substitutes for political polls.

"Volkswagen planning forced layoffs and 10% pay cuts, labor union say","Volkswagen is considering widespread pay cuts and layoffs as well as the closure or size reduction of its plants in Germany, the company’s works council said Monday.

The Volkswagen management recently presented plans to the council that include a 10% reduction in pay across the board, as well as wage freezes in 2025 and 2026, according to Daniela Cavallo, head of the works council. All factored in, the body estimates workers will suffer pay cuts of around 18% over the period.

Volkswagen also intends to shut three factories and downsize all other plants in Germany, Cavallo said, adding that sweeping job cuts were part of carmaker’s plan.

Cheaper to buy long call or protective put,"Suppose I like a stock with current price of $100 and I am bullish but nervous and I have 2 options.

2. Or buy stock with cash. And a put with strike 100.

Both options are for 1 year and I intend to hold until expiry.

Why Did Biogen’s Stock Drop Despite Strong Earnings and Analyst Upgrades (Aug 2024)?,"I’m trying to understand why Biogen’s stock dropped right after its \*August 2024 earnings call\*, even though the company reported strong numbers, raised guidance, and received multiple analyst upgrades. All the indicators—company performance, analysts, and earnings—were positive, so why did the market seem to ignore these and push the stock down?

To be clear, I'm not looking to debate trading vs. investing strategies or the randomness of the stock market. My question is straightforward: given that both the company and the analysts seemed to signal ""buy"" or ""hold,"" why did the market make an independent decision to sell?

Looking for some insights here, so if you don’t know or just want to yell ‘market’s random,’ kindly move along without blowing my mind. If anyone can provide insights on why this happened that’d be appreciated.

Finviz screener question~ 


I keep seeing a lot of setups for potential long plays and short squeezes around here, but I’m curious about the flip side.

What indicators or setups do you look for when identifying good short or put candidates? I’m wondering about the best signals that suggest a stock could see a decline.

Are there any specific technical indicators, chart patterns, or fundamental red flags that tend to give you the green light? Or maybe particular market conditions that you feel make a short play more likely to pay off?

Would the implementation of 24/5 trading at NYSE have implications for options and theta in general?,"It’s already public news that the NYSE is setting forth the agenda of creating 22hr/day trading as a result of tensions from Robinhood’s trading hours. 

The question begets, let me preface this by saying I am in no means an options expert or have my toes dipped deep in the realms of options trading in general, but the natural question that arises from such an implementation would ultimately be - how does this affect option pricing and trading in general?

Currently, non-fut options are being traded from 9:30-5PM EST, that is a timespan of ~7-8 hours a day. Technically, if I’m able to trade options for 3x the duration, what would the underlying implications of this be in terms of delta and theta variances? There was always an implicit understanding that MMs would price options on Friday for next week with Sat/Sun theta in mind.

Just curious on your takes for the future options trading environment, and if there are any possible strategies to take note of in the future.",28,8,1730019415.0
DOJ explaining why you should invest in Visa ,"Excerpt is from their lawsuit against V


5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls ""a chicken-and-egg problem."" To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, ""build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees"" is ""a herculean task."" Visa further recognizes that these effects create ""an enormous moat"" around its business.

6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as ""PIN networks"" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.

7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.

Why Cancel shares instead of convert to Treasury shares during Buyback?,"Greetings, when a company does share buybacks (i.e. share repurchase), my understanding is that it must either cancel those shares or hold them as treasury shares.

  
Why would a company cancel the shares as opposed to holding onto them as treasury shares?

  
My limited thinking would be that converting them to treasury shares would be better as: (1) the company would retain the ability to reissue them at a later date, (2) the company would limit outside ownership (e.g. prevent hostile takeover), and (3) the company would still retain the ability to always cancel the shares in the future.

up 37% YTD, up 200% over the past 5 years.

Sales, revenue, all up year over year -- consistently. 2020 net income was 4 Billion, 2024 is on track for 7.3 Billion. Nearly double in four years.

Hasn't split in 25 years and gained 2780% since that split.

Their dividends are meek, except when they do special dividends (last one was $15/share in Dec '23). Current dividends are at $1.16 and they go up every year (four and up). So they should be considered a dividend aristocrat I suppose, except those special dividends kind of throw off the calculation.

GSL Global Ship Lease -- value trap?,"[GSL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GSL&ty=c&p=d&b=1) seems to offer great value on paper.

* P/B of 0.63

* Dividend of 7%

* Dividend payout ratio of 18%

* Profit margin of 45%

* Free cash flow is fine



The greatest fault I can find is that its debt/equity ratio is high at 0.54 and it has issued a fair amount of long term debt recently. 

Despite strong operational performance, it's shown mediocre share performance. Over the last 10 years, it's had an annual return of only 1.6% including dividend reinvestment.

Conversely, the last 5 years would return 32% annually. 

It seems like it tanked in the 2015-16 selloff and never recovered. Yet today it's operating very profitably.

What’s the stock you’ll never sell,"Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.

I agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. 

I think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).

I’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.

Other candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.

"Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results","Results for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:

Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants

Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year

Restaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%

Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses

Seven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened

Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.

Jerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”

Morgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”

The Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.

NYSE plans to extend daily trading to 22 hours on its Arca exchange,"[https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680](https://www.ft.com/content/59dc109d-d385-412a-bcc6-b671db9ce680)

>The New York Stock Exchange announced plans to extend trading hours for equities on its Arca venue to 22 hours on weekdays, in an effort to meet global demand for buying and selling US-listed assets around the clock. NYSE, which is part of Intercontinental Exchange, said the extended trading hours for its all-electronic Arca exchange would cover 1:30am to 11:30pm Eastern time, excluding holidays. The proposed expansion, which targets a 2025 launch and is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows the increased popularity in recent years of round-the-clock retail trading offered via brokerage platforms such as Robinhood and Interactive Brokers. “As the steward of the US capital markets, the NYSE is pleased to lead the way in enabling exchange-based trading for our US-listed companies and funds to investors in time zones across the globe,” Kevin Tyrrell, head of markets at the NYSE, said in a statement on Friday. NYSE plans to seek regulatory approval for the extended trading hours from the SEC as well as “US securities information processors”, such as the Consolidated Tape Association. The “tape” represents the official record of trading prices on exchanges, so the inclusion of night-time activity would be more likely to set the early tone for regular trading hours. NYSE Arca is best known as a venue for exchange traded funds and also hosts certain stocks and closed-end funds. Year-to-date, the Arca exchange has traded about $27.7bn a day in ETFs and about $21.8bn per day in corporate stocks, according to NYSE. It already has a broader operating window than the NYSE itself, with sessions running from 4am to 8pm Eastern time. Regular NYSE trading hours are 9.30am to 4pm Eastern time. Retail trading has boomed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the increased salience of cryptocurrencies. Assets such as US Treasuries, currencies and stock index futures can already be traded outside of normal exchange hours. That trend has put pressure on NYSE to consider widening its trading hours, and earlier this year prompted the group to poll market participants on the merits of trading stocks around the clock. Some retail brokers already offer 24/7 trading where trades overnight are matched through a “dark pool” venue that matches night-time trades in the US with daytime buying and selling in Asia.

**Tl;dr:** NYSE Arca wants to change its trading hours from currently **4am - 8pm** to **1:30am - 11:30pm**. Needs SEC approval.",138,51,1729879366.0
75 people affected in E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders: CDC,"A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders has led to 75 cases in 13 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday, as it investigates the source of the spread. 

The outbreak has led to 22 hospitalizations and one previously reported death of an older adult in Colorado.

Out of 61 patients with information available, 22 have been hospitalized and two people have developed a serious condition that can cause kidney failure, called hemolytic uremic syndrome. All of the 42 people who were interviewed by the CDC reported eating at McDonald’s, while 39 people reported eating a beef hamburger, the agency said.

Those with infections ranged between ages 13 and 88, according to the CDC. The agency reiterated that the number of cases in the outbreak is likely much higher than what has been reported so far. The CDC added that the outbreak may not be limited to the states with related cases. That is because many patients do not test for E. coli and recover from an infection without receiving medical care, the CDC said. It also usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Shares of the restaurant chain fell 2% on the update. The stock is down 6% since the CDC announced the outbreak on Tuesday, initially citing 49 cases and one death across 10 states.

McDonald’s declined to comment on the update, citing the company’s statement when the outbreak was first announced.

Quarter Pounder hamburgers are a core menu item for McDonald’s, raking in billions of dollars annually.

Health officials are closely examining the slivered onions used in the Quarter Pounder as a likely contaminant. McDonald’s has instructed restaurants in the affected area to remove slivered onions from their supply, and has paused the distribution of that ingredient in the region.

McDonald’s stores in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming as well as parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have temporarily stopped using Quarter Pounder slivered onions and beef patties, according to the CDC.

McDonald’s identified California-based produce giant Taylor Farms as the supplier for the sliced onions the company removed from its supply chain. Taylor Farms has issued a recall on four raw onion products due to potential E. coli contamination. Burger King, Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell have pulled onions from select restaurants in response to the outbreak.

But federal agencies are also investigating the Quarter Pounder’s beef patty as a potential culprit.

As the CDC and other federal agencies trace cases and work to contain the outbreak, McDonald’s has pulled Quarter Pounders from restaurants in the affected areas. Around a fifth of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants are not selling Quarter Pounder burgers.

McDonald’s spokespeople said Wednesday that it is too early to tell if the outbreak is having any effect on traffic to its restaurants.

The company is expected to report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday and could share more details with investors about the situation on the conference call.

The outbreak comes after several quarters of sluggish U.S. sales for McDonald’s. Price-sensitive consumers have not been visiting restaurants as much, leading McDonald’s and other fast-food chains to turn to value meals to boost sales. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to report U.S. same-store sales growth of 0.5% for the third quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.

For now, McDonald’s is trying to reassure customers that its menu items are safe to eat and drink and that it is taking the outbreak seriously. Experts told CNBC that barring a more serious crisis, the damage to its brand may be minimal, as with an E. coli outbreak linked to Wendy’s two years ago.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Are you convinced Tesla is back to growth?,"There were bets on the stock going either way on earnings, but nobody predicted such a decisive beat on auto gross margins and EPS. For the first time in almost 3 years, the pump is halfway justified by fundamentals.

Tesla stock has best day in over a decade on Musk's 2025 growth projection,"Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.

The company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.

“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.

Tesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.

Automakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.

Tesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”

CEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.

Even bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.

It “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.

A grain of salt

Musk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.

Bernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”

Musk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. 

The Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”

They pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.

The share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.

Is $SMR facing badluck or it will eventually breakthough?,"Badluck

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/25/us-firm-eliminated-from-race-build-britain-first-mini-nuke/

The naysayers are stating due to unproven technology, nobody wants to be the 1st guinea pig.  It is costly upfront and if something goes wrong they might be on hook in fines and penalties (hazardous material handling).

But this said... recently, the Biden admin has greenlit financial assistance approval for nuclear energy related projects.  

China and Russia already have approved SMRs and I believe they have a few already up and running.  

The unfairness is that - their gov't can absorb the costs if something goes wrong. 

Questions

1. Why doesn't the US gov't go a little deeper into the projects and bear some of the costs/potential dangers associated with it? 

2. Big companies like Amazon and Google have signed up partnerships with energy companies for SMR to be designed/built.  Why don't they just partner with a company like NuScale instead (approved SMR design)?

At the end of day, in 10 years... if energy infrastructure stays the way it is - the US could be way behind Russia/China in terms of energy source/efficienct. Nevermind inability to power many data centers etc. and not ability to meet its clean energy goals.

CAVA Expansion Continues - Midwest Expansion Spotlight ,"I will start this by saying I am probably too obsessed with CAVA. I have known the Company since 2017 and hold 550 shares with a $49 avg basis. 

Being in the greater Detroit area I can only get CAVA when I travel out east for business. This, I say with great enthusiasm, is about to change. Through meticulous stalking of CAVA’s job postings, I have discovered that it is the Company’s intention to expand from their initial  entry in the Midwest market (Chicago) to both the Indianapolis and Detroit areas.

The timeline is uncertain, but if I were to guess, there could be up to four store locations around each city by YE 2025.

CAVA has had enormous success since their summer 2023 IPO (up 208%). The Company has around 330 locations across 28 states, with a stated goal of 1000 locations by 2032. There are concerns from some that the Company is currently way overvalued, while others contend that the market is only pricing in some of the growth and white space ahead. Regardless, I am very much looking forward to having this option near me.

"Tesla’s Not a Car Company, Musk’s in the Business of Selling the Future. And 5 Other Things to Know Today.","

It may surprise some to learn that Tesla isn’t really in the car business.

Sure, some 80% of its revenue currently comes from electric vehicles. And CEO Elon Musk is pretty good at squeezing profit out of those cars—something many in the industry still haven’t managed to figure out.

But the most important thing to know about the company is that it trades on more than 70 times forward earnings. Ford and General Motors are on five or six times. This suggests that when investors buy Tesla stock, their expectations are in a different universe from when they buy into other car makers.

Musk is pulling old-school levers to ensure his cars are profitable, even as rivals churn out lower-cost models. It helps that Tesla can now make more vehicles from the same manufacturing base and squeeze suppliers to cushion margins.

At the same time, a closer look at the earnings yesterday—which beat Wall Street estimates—show Tesla’s profits come from plenty of other sources. It made money from software, from selling regulatory credits for making more than its share of zero-emission cars, and from battery storage and charging.

Of course, robotaxis and self-driving cars are the next frontier. They’re not really cars—the robotaxi won’t even have a steering wheel or pedals. They are a bet on technology and artificial intelligence, not the automotive industry. It’s why Tesla is one of Nvidia’s best customers.

There’s a story about Ray Kroc, the businessman who made McDonald’s the most successful fast-food corporation, and the value of knowing exactly what business you’re really in. For McDonald’s, it’s real estate, not hamburgers.

Elon Musk knows he’s not in the car business. He’s selling the future. The tricky part will be delivering on his promises when expectations are already so high.

Earnings Database that auto-updates,"First off, if anyone knows of a service that provides the above, LMK. Earnings Whisper might, but whether they include screen pics of the price action of previous quarters, I do not know.

Secondly, I've created my own record of earnings behaviors over a couple of years of quarters. Each folder named after the stock ticker includes screenshots of past earnings behaviors. Thing is, I can not stand to move the folders every quarterly cycle. It's a lot of tedious work. Yes I could stick to a selection but I'm ambitious. 

Many hit the same day of the week of the quarter, but most do not hit the exact same day. Can anyone think of the best approach that I could keep these folders, but they would auto update to the upcoming date of the earnings? Maybe I need to put these folders in a calendar that can suck in data. Schwab TOS has a good calendar. I wish I could dump my folders of screenpics into an extension of their calendar.

I know Google sheets has stock ticker data that autofills price. I don't know if coming earnings date is a field that auto updates. If it did, I assume I could dump my entire folder into that google sheets folder MAYBE.

"Nvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record Q3 profit, beats forecasts","SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.

The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.

That compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.

SK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.

""HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,"" SK Hynix said in a statement.

SK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.

Revenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.

SK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.

Last month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.",97,18,1729733950.0
Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",338,486,1729714585.0

Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now – potentially becoming the world’s most valuable company by a huge margin – as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here’s why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let’s let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That’s about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we’re talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait… there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they’re stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential – it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn’t out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren’t so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor’s backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don’t forget Google’s got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That’s a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars – no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren’t unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that’s a neat $150 billion in profits. What’s that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company’s market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time – quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck – if you’re concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

US SEC is having a set of eyes targeting at the short sellers.,"* The SEC accused Ryan Choi of ""negligently engaging in a scheme to defraud"" the readers of Citron Research in connection with two social media posts with recommendations to buy two US stocks.

* The settlement is likely to be a blow to Andrew Left, an activist short seller and the founder of Citron Research who is fighting SEC and Department of Justice charges filed in July alleging he engaged in a scheme to defraud Citron Research followers by publishing false and misleading statements regarding his stock trading recommendations.
* The authorities in Los Angeles claimed Andrew Left generated at least $16 million in illegal trading profits through stock manipulation. Prosecutors and regulators accused him of using his fame to tell investors to do one thing while he traded the other way.
* The SEC called it a “bait and switch” strategy.  Mr. Left apparently bought back stock immediately after telling his readers to sell, and he sold stocks immediately after telling his readers to buy.
* Federal prosecutors claim Mr. Left used exaggerated language in his commentary and manipulated stock prices with his social media posts.

"What does it mean when the stock price rises, while the short interest rises alongside it?","In the case of the stock CompoSecure (CMPO) ([info](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/cmpo)), I have the following data:

TLT too low to be ignored?,"Just wanted to share some thoughs about yields and bonds that ive heard recently that caught my eye, maybe get some feedback or different ideas. This in the context of 10YR yields that went from **3.7%** to **4.2%** after the FED made the 50bps. The FEDs mandate, as you all know, is to balance employment and inflation.

**Employment:**

Some of the climb in yields comes from the idea that the economy is strong, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.3% in July and then dropping since. A Bloomberg columnist wrote an interesting piece that talked about the idea that unemployment rate hasn’t peaked yet, due to 3 factors that played a key role in the September report.

1. Hiring in the education sector after an earlier delay
2. Outsized election spending
3. Responses to natural disasters

According to her, the drop from 4.22% to 4.05% in the unemployment rate was almost entirely driven by a 785k increase in government jobs (3.6 standard deviation move), which was the second largest monthly jump in government hiring since January 1990. Meanwhile, other Jobs fell 355k and as a result, total employment rose 430k net according to household data. Some possible explanations for the unusual increase in government hiring could be:

* The fast hiring in education, probably due to a later hiring schedule.
* A surge in hiring related to the presidential election — campaign-related activity saw an unusual increase in federal-level protective services in several swing states and Illinois — added 200,000 jobs, by their estimate.
* Emergency personnel related to reconstruction after damage by Hurricane Beryl and wildfires likely contributed about 100,000 jobs.

By their calculus, without the election cycle boost and the impact from natural disasters, the unemployment rate would have been 4.23%. Their conclusion is that those effects should persist in a lesser way in October but start reversing in December and expect a 4.5% by EOY.

**Inflation:**

Now let’s turn to the actual inflation data, the breakdown of the components of inflation ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE AN IMAGE HERE BUT THIS SUB DOESNT ALLOW GRAPHS AND STUFF).~~***

Services is the one big component that keeps pushing inflation higher, with Core Goods and energy contributing negatively to inflation (meaning they are showing lower prices now). What’s in the Services category? Well I have this table cause I got too lazy to make another graph: ***~~(THERE SHOULD BE A TABLE HERE TOO)~~***

Most of the inflation comes from Shelter, Medical Care Services and transportation services. Let’s talk about Shelter specifically. Everybody here knows that the housing market is nuts right now, there is not enough new supply to cover the demand, and the existing supply is locked due to the high mortgages. The idea here is basically that HIGHER INTEREST RATES WON’T alleviate this component, lower rates might help actually due to unlocking existing houses in the market.

Finally, last week we got retail sales that spooked some participants, but we already know that goods have been in negative territory for the last months so there shouldn’t be much problem there.

**Trade:**

Ive been shorting the TLT puts for a while, closed most of them when we got the 50 bps cut and then as we came down ive been adding. I did some of them too soon I think. Anyhow this are my positions:

* Long TLT shares
* Short Dec 20 puts, Strikes: $100, 95, 93, 90
* Short Nov 08 calls, $96.5 just to cover some of the long exposure

I think worst case I’d end up getting assigned a bunch of TLT into 2025 and going into the new year basically all in on TLT. I am getting worried tho because recently ive heard a lot of commentary about FED making a mistake with people like Stanley Druckenmiller shorting bonds with convincing arguments.

EDIT: I forgot something else, there is also the spread between the bond yields and earnings yields of the S&P which is right now at historical extremes, basically saying its more attractive than stocks.",5,9,1729629067.0

Starbucks shares slide after preliminary results show sales fell again,"Starbucks on Tuesday posted preliminary quarterly results, which showed its sales fell again.

Nearly two months ago, CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the coffee giant after two quarters of same-store sales declines.

He aims to reverse slowing demand for Starbucks’ drinks, particularly in its two largest markets: the United States and China. In the U.S., the chain has been losing its occasional customers, who have opted to save money instead of spending on its macchiatos and Refreshers. Starbucks’ business in China has also been struggling to recover ever since the pandemic, and the rise of cheaper local rivals like Luckin Coffee and a more cautious consumer have dented sales in recent months.

Niccol joined Starbucks after six years as CEO of Chipotle; during his tenure at the fast-casual chain, he led the company through a turnaround after its foodborne illness crises, invested in its digital business and turned it into a top industry performer, even during the pandemic.

To curb Starbucks’ sales slump, Niccol plans to turn first to the company’s struggling U.S. business. In an open letter released during his first week on the job, he said he plans to focus on four areas of improvement: the barista experience, morning service, its cafes and the company’s branding.

Niccol has also been reshuffling the company’s executive ranks. On Friday, the company announced a former Chipotle executive, Tressie Lieberman, will be joining Starbucks as its global chief brand officer, a newly created position. And last month, Starbucks said its North American CEO Michael Conway would retire after just five months in the role; Niccol’s predecessor Laxman Narasimhan had appointed Conway before his ouster in August.

Shares of Starbucks are up 1% this year, as of Tuesday’s close. The company has a market cap of more than $109 billion.

The company is expected to report its fiscal-fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Oct. 30.

Overall bullish about RDDT.

RDDT is not like Perplexity. But can provide data for it (or similar).

Could RDDT potentially get sued for selling data and some company like News Corp claim its theirs?

Or what about paywalled articles that are posted for free on some sub reddits.  Could RDDT be sued or fined for not tackling/preventing this issue?

Thoughts on Walmart?,"I'm considering picking up some shares but thought I'd see what the sub thinks.

Walmart's up 56% YTD which seems pretty astonishing for any retailer, let alone the largest company by revenue in the world.

Speaking of that revenue, it's grown from $524B in 2020 to $648B currently. P/E is 42 and EPS growth forecast according to Schwab for the 3-5 year horizon is 10.17%, which is higher than Costco and Target. 

Now they're moving into pharmaceutical delivery in an attempt to box out Walgreen's and CVS. It's a troublesome area, and WMT didn't fair well opening affordable health clinics, but does signal intent to continue growing revenue at a fast clip. 

Anecdotally, WMT seems like a great business. Their online and in-store shopping process has always been great IMO. I fondly remember my days in college going to the all night supercenter to find badly needed ping pong balls on a Saturday evening.

Any important facts or considerations I'm missing? Would love to see everyone else's POV.",20,45,1729621597.0
Lockheed Martin Stock Sinks as F-35 Sales Decline Weighs on Revenue,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares tumbled Tuesday as the defense contractor missed revenue estimates on a drop in aerospace sales.

The company reported third-quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year to $17.10 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $17.38 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.80 exceeded forecasts.

Lockheed's Aeronautics unit sales declined 3% to $6.49 billion, primarily because of delays in contractual authorization and funding for the F-35 fighter jet. Sales at its Space division were down less than 1% to $3.08 billion. Missiles and Fire Control segment revenue jumped 8% to $3.18 billion, and Rotary and Mission Systems unit revenue was 6% higher at $4.37 billion.

The company raised its full-year EPS outlook to $26.65 from a range of $26.10 to $26.60, and narrowed its revenue outlook to $71.25 billion from the previous $70.50 billion to $71.50 billion. 

Shares of Lockheed Martin hit an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's roughly 5% declines they're up nearly 30% year-to-date.

Would I be paying more taxes and losing more money withdrawing profits from stocks vs just keeping Salary? ,"I want to invest a lot of my salary into stocks to make more money. But if I withdraw profits  from stock, I have to pay more taxes.

For example, let’s say I make $2000 a month salary. Then let’s say I profit $2000 from a stock a month. Would this actually make me lose more money paying double taxes? Or would this just make me even, meaning no difference if I had just kept my salary and never invested. ",0,28,1729610474.0
"Halliburton DD, Undervalued or value trap?","Hey there,  
I've been thinking of ways to profit off of potential war spiking oil up and Trump winning the election bext month. Obvious plays would be Oil or DJT respectively, but both are iffy at best. That's where I'd remembered that I've invested a few times into Halliburton $HAL, mostly swinging it for 20% and it's that time of the year again.

So what's their business? - Halliburton is one of the largest oil field service companies in the world. It provides a wide range of services and products to the energy industry, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production. Halliburton operates in over 70 countries and serves both national and independent oil and gas companies. I'll use ChatGPT to summarise the business underlying.

So what's my conviction? - You've got two ways to profit off of this business plus a large safety net in the form of a relative undervaluation. Technically speaking, the company is trading near the multi-years bottoms and the business has improved since.   
1st case: Drill baby, drill! - In case of Trump delivering on his promises to increase the rate of drilling, Halliburton profits, as it's literally their business

2nd case: Israel - Iran war breaking out - Oil is bound to increase in price as the risks increase and or the fields in the middle east get destroyed. In any case, since the company is in the Oil sector, it's bound to increase in price  
3rd case: None of these above happen - You've got a profitable, dividend paying company trading under the intrinsic value, that is projected to increase in price as per analysts' view - Lowest 52w target is still SIGNIFICANTLY above the current price

# Business breakdown (done using ChatGPT, please don't stone me)

1. **Completion and Production**
   * Services and products related to the completion of oil and gas wells, such as well cementing, stimulation (including hydraulic fracturing), and production enhancement.
   * Includes tools and systems that help improve oil and gas well output.
2. **Drilling and Evaluation**:
   * Provides services like directional drilling, well logging, and reservoir evaluation.
   * Offers technologies and services that help customers locate oil and gas reserves and understand reservoir characteristics.

# Major Services and Products:

* **Drilling Services**: Including equipment, tools, and techniques to drill and stabilize oil wells.
* **Hydraulic Fracturing**: A key service for extracting oil and natural gas from unconventional resources like shale.
* **Cementing**: Securing well integrity and preventing leaks between rock formations and drilled areas.
* **Artificial Lift**: Techniques and tools that help lift oil from the well to the surface when the reservoir pressure isn't sufficient.

I'm currently invested in at about 7.5% of my portfolio @ $28.3, ready to double down if it drops, as I trully believe this could be a good hedge againts war and possibly even major recession - Oil tends to get expensive

Walmart will start delivering prescriptions as CVS and Walgreens struggle,"As CVS and Walgreens shutter hundreds of stores nationwide to shore up profits and investor sentiment, Walmart said Tuesday that it is offering a new option for customers: Delivering prescriptions to their doorsteps.

The nation’s largest retailer said deliveries are now available in six states: Arkansas, Missouri, New York, Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The company said in a news release that it expects to deliver prescriptions in 49 states by the end of January. Prescription deliveries will not be available in North Dakota due to state laws, Walmart said.

The prescription delivery service is another example of how Walmart is trying to outmatch competitors on convenience along with low prices. With the new service, customers can get a mix of items dropped off during the same delivery, such as a box of tissues, blanket or chicken noodle soup.

Walmart’s new delivery offering could be another blow to drugstore chains, which are falling out of favor with consumers in a trend that has hit their profits and stock prices and forced them to reconsider their strategies. Still, it is unclear how much market share Walmart could win from CVS and Walgreens, both of which offer same-day, one-day and two-day prescription deliveries.

Tom Ward, chief e-commerce officer for Walmart U.S., said the company added pharmacy deliveries because of shopper demand.

“This is actually the number one service requested by our customers,” he said.

He said Walmart tested the deliveries in several states and saw that customers took advantage of getting a mix of items, including the prescription, in a single delivery.

Walmart’s delivery service will be available for new prescriptions and refills, the company said. It will cost $9.95 for a delivery, the standard price for Walmart doorstep deliveries, but will be free for members of Walmart+, the company’s membership program.

Health insurance plans will be applied to the transaction, like they would in the store, the company said.

The deliveries will come with a few more safety steps than Walmart’s other deliveries, the company said: Medications will be put into tamper-evident packaging. Customers can track orders in real time through Walmart’s app or website and get a photo in the app or by email when the prescription is delivered. And when a customer orders a new prescription and chooses delivery, they are prompted to do a consultation with the pharmacy by phone.

Most of Walmart’s annual revenue in the U.S. – nearly 60% – comes from groceries, but health and wellness is a growing category for the company, according to the retailer’s most recent annual filing for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. Health and wellness accounts for about 12% of its annual revenue in the U.S. It includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.

A new challenge for drugstores

As of Monday’s close, shares of Walmart were up around 54% for the year. Meanwhile, shares of CVS were down roughly 26% so far this year, while shares of Walgreens were down nearly 60%.

CVS is the top U.S. pharmacy in terms of prescription drug revenue, holding more than 25% of the market share in 2023, according to Statista data released in March. Walgreens trailed behind with nearly 15% of that share last year, while Walmart held just 5% of that share.

CVS and Walgreens are grappling with falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs. Inflation, softer consumer spending and competition from Amazon, big-box retailers and grocery stores are making it difficult for them to turn a profit at the front of the store, which carries cleaning supplies, beauty products and pantry staples, among other items.

CVS CEO Karen Lynch left the company and was replaced by David Joyner last week, as CVS faces pressure from Wall Street and, more recently, an activist investor to turn around its business. On top of the leadership shakeup, CVS plans to cut $2 billion in expenses over several years. That includes slashing less than 1% of its workforce, or roughly 2,900 jobs, on the corporate side of its business.

The company is also wrapping up a three-year plan to close 900 of its stores, with 851 locations closed as of August.

Walgreens is similarly cutting costs, announcing last week that it will close roughly 1,200 stores over the next three years, which includes 500 in fiscal 2025 alone. The chain has around 8,700 locations in the U.S., a quarter of which it says are unprofitable.

Walmart has faced its own financial challenges on the health-care side of the business. The discounter planned to bring its low-price spin to health care by opening clinics that offered doctor, dentist and therapy appointments for less.

Yet in the spring, Walmart shuttered all of the clinics, saying in a news release at the time that it couldn’t operate a profitable business because of “the challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs.”

"Peloton partners with Costco to sell Bike+ as it looks to reach young, wealthy customers","Peloton’s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco’s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.

Under the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton’s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton’s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. 

The new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.

Long focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.

As sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. 

“We’ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,” said Camp Sanders. “We’ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco’s very large net incremental audience.” 

Camp Sanders said Peloton’s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.

The deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.

As of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. 

Costco’s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness — and are willing to invest in it — in ways that older generations do not. 

About half of Costco’s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. 

According to Numerator, 36% of Costco’s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country’s population.

Camp Sanders said Costco’s members “have the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,” and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. 

“Many of Peloton’s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,” said Camp Sanders. “Many Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career … and they’ve got the space in their home” to build their own gyms, he continued. 

Costco’s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.

Peloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. 

For example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. 

It also announced a deal with Truemed — the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world — that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.

Big Share Growth Potential with Low P/E and High EPS Projection: Golden Entertainment (GDEN),"Disclosure: I own both stock and calls for GDEN that I plan on holding past the earnings on 11/7.  Do your own research too!

TLDR: P/E ratio significantly lower than industry average (3.3 vs. >15), favorable foot-traffic and occupancy data, Marketbeat predicts over $500 earnings growth over the next year

Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ: GDEN) offers a compelling opportunity for value investors, thanks to its attractive valuation, strategic growth, and improving foot traffic trends. Here’s why GDEN deserves a closer look.

**Key Fundamentals and Considerations**

1. **Valuation:**
   * **P/E Ratio:** 3.35 (vs. sector peers like Sands at 24, MGM at 15 and Wynn at 13). This suggests GDEN is deeply undervalued compared to the market​
2. **Improving Hotel Performance:**
   * **STRAT Hotel and Casino** achieved **record revenue** in Q2 2024.
   * **ADR increased by 8%**, with **occupancy rising 4%** YoY to 73%.
   * Weekend occupancy hit an impressive **97%**, while midweek occupancy improved to **64%**, demonstrating growing visitor traffic
3. **Earnings Call on November 7, 2024:**
   * With a projected **516% EPS increase** over the next year, the upcoming earnings call could trigger significant upside. (Marketbeat)

**Risks to Monitor**

* **Insider Sales:** Recent sales by insiders reflect cautious profit-taking but not necessarily a lack of confidence, as insiders still retain significant holdings​
* **Sector Volatility:** While improving, hospitality and gaming sectors remain sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.

**Conclusion:** potential high value play with growth potential

Golden Entertainment’s rising foot traffic, particularly at the STRAT, coupled with its undervaluation, makes it an intriguing investment. With growing momentum in its core Nevada operations and expansion in tavern locations, GDEN offers a promising blend of growth and value.",0,1,1729536539.0

10-year Treasury yield jumps as investors monitor Fed speeches,"It would be interesting to see that 10-year Treasury yield keeps going up when Fed starts to cut interest rates in September 2024 ... something went wrong very probably \~

*The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jumped on Monday as investors digest a flurry of speeches from Federal Reserve policymakers.*  
  
*The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose more than 9 basis points to 4.172 %. The yield on the 2-year Treasury was up about 7 basis points to 4.025%.*  
  
*Yields and prices move in opposite directions. One basis point equals 0.01%.*  
  
*On a day without any major economic data releases, market participants are likely to scrutinize comments from officials at the U.S. central bank.*  
  
*Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan said Monday she supports the current move to lowering interest rates, but that a patient approach will be needed.*  
  
*“If the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals,” Logan said during a speech in New York. “However, any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. In my view, the \[Federal Open Market Committee\] will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.”*  
  
*Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are also delivering remarks on Monday.*  
  
*The Federal Open Market Committee took the unusual step last month of lowering its baseline interest rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, to a target range of 4.75% to 5%.*",112,38,1729528352.0

Another 30 days approx if that, it will definitely go positive. 
  
Then we will find out if it this time is different. 
  
I find it funny that the Fed started cutting rates on September 18th 2024, they also started cutting rates on September 18th 2007….. by .50 basis points both times.

AI ETF's or VGT/QQQ?,"Are there any good etfs dedicated to AI or is it a better idea to invest in technology focused ETFs such as VGT or QQQ?

I purchased a few shares of SMH but it is more focused on the hardware aspect of AI. Also, it went down after I have purchased and I have been in the negative for quite some time. So I am not very hopeful about it and hence looking at AI ETF's specifically focused on the software side like OPEN AI, perplexity etc.

Disney will name new CEO in early 2026; Gorman to become board chair next year,"Disney has tapped James Gorman to replace Mark Parker as the company’s next chairman, effective in January, as the media giant lays the groundwork to name a successor for CEO Bob Iger in early 2026, the company said Monday.

Gorman joined Disney’s board less than a year ago and was named the head of the succession planning committee in August. He will continue to lead that committee after he takes over as board chairman from Nike Executive Chairman Parker.

“The Disney board has benefited tremendously from James Gorman’s expertise and guidance, and we are lucky to have him as our next chairman – particularly as the board continues to move forward with the succession process,” Iger said in a statement. “I’m extremely grateful to Mark Parker for his many years of board service and leadership, which have been so valuable to this company and its shareholders, and to me as CEO.”

Parker will step down after nine years on the Disney board “to focus on other areas” of his work, according to a Disney statement. That includes spending more time working on Nike-related matters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Elliott Hill took over as Nike CEO last week, replacing John Donahoe.

Early 2026

Disney had initially targeted 2025 to announce a successor, as CNBC reported last year. Pushing the date back to early 2026 will give the board more time to conduct due diligence on both internal and external candidates, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.

Gorman has experience with succession planning: He oversaw the orderly transfer of power at Morgan Stanley, with Ted Pick succeeding him as CEO there at the start of this year.

Succession hasn’t been smooth at Disney. The board fired Iger’s handpicked successor, Bob Chapek, in November 2022 after a turbulent tenure that lasted less than three years. Iger returned to the CEO job, and now, Disney shareholders are eager to see a succession plan stick.

Iger’s four direct reports — ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro, and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Dana Walden and Alan Bergman — have all interviewed with the succession committee in recent weeks, since Gorman took over in August, according to the people familiar.

Gorman said in a CNBC interview in March, before taking over as the board’s succession chair, that Disney was running a “forward-looking, forward-leaning, incredibly disciplined process.”

Still, while putting a specific timeline on naming a successor adds a bit of clarity to the search, it also means the question of who will take over for Iger will continue to hover over the company for another year.

Iger has pushed back his retirement five different times to continue to lead Disney as CEO. Activist investor Nelson Peltz focused on the board’s failure to name a lasting successor in his unsuccessful campaign to gain board seats earlier this year.

Iger’s current contract as CEO runs until Dec. 31, 2026. He and the board haven’t decided if Iger will extend his board tenure past 2026, said the people familiar.

Goldman Sachs predicts only 3% annualized returns of S&P500 over the next decade,"According to Goldman Sachs forecast, S&P500 will give only 3% annualized return over next 10 years which is bellow average of S&P500 returns in last 100 years (11% per year on average).

"ALT  Obesity, hype is not over.   Upside enormous ","Obesity stock. Altimmune  management has continuously stated: **We want a partner at the Phase 3 Trial design meeting with the FDA**

Meeting, as per PR, early November. Therefore, a partner anticipated to be announce any day now. Though, to be honest - we have been waiting for a year now. Altimmune, unlike others, is in advanced stages and has FAST TRACK STATUS.

If this comes true, retail can sit in a warm bath together with Sexy Institutions and Shorts.

* Float 71 million
* Institutional ownership 63%, 43 million
* Short 31%, 22 million
   * **Do the math: Retail left-overs?**

===============================

A bit of DD mixed with opinion:

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",4,7,1729500608.0

Ripe for picking - (FDMT) 4D Molecular Therapeutics?,"Their current pipeline focus ""4D-150"" is for treatment of Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

FDMT current market cap $443.30M

1. **Potential Market:**
   - 20 million US citizens aged 40 and older have AMD, with 200,000 new cases added each year.
   - 10-15% are Wet AMD, so 2-3 million affected.
   - Current treatment involves Anti-VEGF shots into the eye every 4-12 weeks (lifelong treatment, no cure).
   - Latest 4D-150 Phase 2 results show ""83% overall reduction in annualized injections through 52 weeks"" and ""70% injection-free through 52 weeks"".
   - It's RNA-based, so shots will need to be repeated eventually.
   - Current anti-VEGF treatment costs $13,875 to $24,000 per person annually.
   - Conservative estimate: 4D-150 priced at $15,000 per shot (likely 2-3x higher as it's gene therapy), capturing 20% of 2 million market = 400,000 patients.
   - **Potential annual revenue: $6 billion (400,000 * $15,000)**
   - Global anti-VEGF market: $12.3 billion in 2022, estimated $13.7 billion by 2031.
   - If 4D-150 captures 20% of that: $2.46 billion annually.
   - **Potential market cap: $7.38 billion (3x revenue)** - a 1463% increase from current value (assuming successful Phase 3 and market entry). Assuming it will take 3-5 years for the drug to hit the market, we are looking at 300%-500% annual yield.

2. **Safety:** ""Comparable to approved anti-VEGF agents"", suggesting likely Phase 3 success and market entry.

3. **Competition:**
   - Currently, no gene therapy drugs for AMD are on the market.
   - 23 gene therapy studies for AMD are in various stages of clinical trials.
   - Among these studies, only three companies are listed on NASDAQ:
   - FDMT, ADVM, RGNX
   - All at similar stages with comparable results (FDMT results slightly better (look at the ""Reduction in Annualized Anti-VEGF Injections"")).

4. **Finances:**
   - FDMT has $541.95M cash, sufficient until 2030 (based on current FCF of -$87.17M)
   - Competitors have 1.5-2 years of cash, likely facing dilution
   - FDMT's market cap should be way higher when compared to those direct competitors (imo).

5. **Stock Performance Paradox:**

Despite consistently positive results, FDMT's stock has experienced a significant decline. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

- Since February 5th presentation which lead to a huge upward spike, FDMT has released two additional analyses of their 4D-150 drug:
  - July 17 presentation
  - September 18 presentation
  - Both show even better numbers than the February results

**Potential Explanation for low stock price: Heavy Shorting**

- [This graph](https://i.imgur.com/xE0EjSx.jpeg) combines data from NASDAQ and StockAnalysis.com
- Between July 13-17 (after 2nd presentation release):
  - Short interest dropped from 10.3M to 9.5M
  - Spike in average daily share volume
- Interpretation: Short sellers likely closed positions after seeing good results, driving the price down

**Unexpected Consequence:**

- This triggered an investigation:
  > ""The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. 4D Molecular Therapeutics released the interim results of its Phase 2 PRISM study on Intravitreal 4D-150 on July 17, 2024. Despite the Company billing the results as positive, the stock fell by more than 35.8% in afternoon trading on the same day.""

- In my opinion, the current situation isn't related to securities fraud, but rather reflects the inherent volatility of the biotech market. However, the mere mention of 'securities fraud' has negatively impacted the company's stock profile, leading to further declines. This has been exacerbated by repeated dissemination of this news on Accesswire since July.
Consequently, short interest has increased significantly, currently **41.39%** of the float is shorted with a 7-day cover period. This level of short interest seems **CRAZY** for a promising pre-revenue biotech stock and suggests the potential for a short squ-eeze.
While the timing is uncertain, the combination of high short interest and extended cover period indicates a likelihood of future price increases.

**TLDR**: FDMT shows strong potential in AMD treatment with better financials than competitors. Current stock price seems undervalued, possibly due to shorting. High short interest suggests potential for a squee-ze raising the current price substantially.

Investing $140k,"My wife has student loans of 200k. We just came into 140k cash from a good deal, but this is pretty much all the savings we have, outside of my 401k and an emergency stash. 

Hey student loans aren’t generating interest atm., just sitting. 

I am thinking to put it all into VTSAX, and pull it out when it gets to 200k to pay them, or when something changes and her loans will start accruing interest again. 

Obviously ideally I’d make bank on stock market and loans wouldn’t accrue interest for a long while etc etc. so there’s money left over after repayment. But I want to be very realistic and careful as loosing that chunk would obviously put us back to square one. 

What do you think of this strategy and are there options I am missing? 

Edit: 1) for context we have 3 kids and a happy marriage. Not considering her leaving after loan is payed, for better or worse. 2) I am asking for advice and not committed to doing this. Just paying off the loan is where we started but we feel that having this chunk can be an opportunity so we want to ensure we talk through all the option and consider the risk for each.

Is a gamestop scenario happening in China right now？,"JD.com (HKG: 9618, NASDAQ: JD), a Chinese e-commerce platform specializing in electronics and premium products, is well-known for its responsive customer support. However, the company has recently gained attention due to a controversial endorsement event by Yang Li, a talk show host known for her misandrist rhetoric and numerous remarks against geeks. Yang's involvement has previously been linked to significant stock price declines for other companies (e.g., 600702.SH, SHA: 600398, and others) that featured her in commercials or as a spokesperson.

Amidst ongoing heated gender debates in China, many of JD's male customers have mobilized through social media to express their discontent. Early actions included calls for JD Plus membership refunds and requests for VAT invoices on past purchases. To date, there have been over 300,000 posts across various social media platforms discussing this issue.

As of yesterday, netizens have escalated their response, withdrawing funds from JD-affiliated investment products and short-term funds. They have also advocated for using JD's lending services to withdraw as much money as possible within the one-month interest-free period, effectively triggering fears of a ""run"" on JD’s financial services. In response, [JD.com](http://JD.com) attempted to mitigate concerns by sending text messages to its financial service users, denying the existence of a run. Ironically, this only fueled further withdrawals, as people feared the situation was real.

Additionally, some users reported that certain JD Finance fund accounts had restricted redemptions, with payment accounts shifting from JD to liquidity borrowing accounts at China Industrial Bank. As of today, reports indicate that Industrial Bank's short-term liquidity funds have been depleted, prompting a further shift of payment accounts to Ping An Bank.

There was a 12% decline in JD's stock following the announcement of Yang Li as the spokesperson for their event. While there was a brief recovery on the 18th after JD issued an apology, many netizens deemed the apology insincere and continued to call for further action over the weekend.",0,3,1729344995.0

Fickle on China,"I'm fickle over China/KWEB. Their stock market is pretty much an on/off switch unlike the US. And they appear to be turning it on again, but it's hard to trust them.

Games Workshop - Hold or Sell?,"In late August I bought €450 of Games Workshop stock.  
For those who don't know, Games Workshop (GW) is a hobby shop based in the UK but with stores across a range of countries in Europe, NA, the Commonwealth and China. The shop is most famous as the designers and producers of the Warhammer franchise.

Typically when I invest I just put money in funds because I don't think I can generally do a better job than professional traders. In this case, I came to the conclusion that the stock was undervalued for two reasons. (1) The stores had returned very healthy growth in the 2023/2024 financial year, including a healthy uptake in footfall (2) the market had underappreciated the impact of the Space Marine 2 game, set to come out in September, on future GW revenue. I'd seen some gameplay footage back in maybe July and was quite confident it was going to be a hit.

My plan was to buy the stock, hold until the half-year report in January and sell if I'm in profit.

Well it looks like I was right...   
GW have capitalized on the success of Space Marine 2 by selling a tie-in starter set.   
These have been selling like hot cakes according to folks I know who work in stores.  
Web chatter seems to agree that footfall is up.  
The markets seem to agree and the stock price has risen about 12% in a month.

All sounds good, right?   
I should stick to my original plan, hold till the January report and then sell when good sales figures buoy the stock price.

The big question mark, however, is an ongoing deal (or lack thereof) with Amazon to produce a small-screen Warhammer 40K series with Henry Cavill as the creative director. Cavill, for reference, is a long-time fan of the IP and is widely expected to do a good job, if a deal were to come through. However, the project has been under a degree of uncertainty following the general contraction of the streaming industry and GW have put a limit of the end of the year to come to a deal, or they're pulling the plug.

Obviously, if the TV show is announced, it could drive the stock price nice and high.  
But if the deal falls through, I'm concerned that this could set the stock back and offset the gains I've made.

So what do you all think?  
(1) Sell now. Bank a nice little return.  
(2) Hold till the January report and hope that there's good news on the Amazon deal, and/or a good half-year report.

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,63,1729263552.0
Nebius set to resume Nasdaq trading after completing split from Russia’s Yandex,"Oct 17 (Reuters) - AI infrastructure firm Nebius Group (NBIS.O), opens new tab said on Thursday its shares will resume Nasdaq trading on Monday after being halted following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
At that time, the stock traded under the ticker of Russian internet giant Yandex through its Amsterdam-based parent company.
In July, a Russian consortium finalized a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the Russia-based assets of Yandex, a move that marked the largest corporate exit since the invasion.

""We are pleased to have our shares trading again on Nasdaq, which opens a new chapter for our company as a publicly traded pure play in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space,"" Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said.
Other Russian companies were suspended and ultimately delisted from Nasdaq, but Nebius maintained a suspended listing during months of negotiations to secure an exit from Russia, provided it could decouple from Yandex.

Many of the same Western shareholders have stakes in Nebius, but the company has undergone a significant transformation.
Once valued at over $30 billion as Russia's equivalent of Google, Nebius is now a fledgling European tech company focused on AI infrastructure, cloud services, and self-driving technology.
AI-FOCUSED

With its Russian ties severed, Nebius is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning AI market, founder and CEO Arkady Volozh told Reuters in July. Nebius plans to invest more than $1 billion by mid-2025.b

""Our ambition is to build one of the world's largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses. This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units (""GPUs"") and capital. These are exactly what we have"", Volozh said.
Nebius had annualized run-rate revenue of $120 million as of September 30, 2024, and it expects to be on track for $170 million to $190 million in annualized run-rate revenue by year end 2024, the statement said.

Nebius Group N.V. (“Nebius Group” or the “Company”; NASDAQ: NBIS) today announces that it has been informed by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that trading in the Company's Class A ordinary shares is scheduled to resume on Monday October 21, 2024.",27,5,1729257249.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

By hiring top engineers to build innovative products, and scaling the product globally, these companies to achieved rapid growth at little cost, resulting in impressive returns to shareholders. Historically, hardware costs were very cheap to scale compared to the revenue it brings in. You could spend a few thousand per month in hosting costs, and bring in millions in profits.

However, this is changing. 7 out of 10 of the top holdings in the S&P500 are gambling huge on AI- they have laid off tens of thousands of the talented engineers that drove their earnings growth, in order to fund expensive acquisitions of AI hardware(Not counting Nvidia because they are the ones profiting from it).

Tech can no longer be seen as an industry with low capital costs, because AI is tremendously expensive to deploy and maintain. For example, Microsoft expects to spend $100 Billion on AI datacenters through Fiscal 2027. That's 40% more than their entire profit in 2023. Because AI hardware is so expensive, and the electricity usage is so tremendous, these future applications are no longer cheap to deploy and maintain.

ChatGPT is perhaps the best example of this. Despite being tremendously successful from a growth perspective, it has been tremendously unprofitable from an operating standpoint, and relies on continued bailouts from large companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Softbank to stay afloat. 

The economics of tech companies is quickly changing; with companies in an arms race to acquire as many Nvidia chips as possible to build the best GenAI applications, they are hurting their margins and operating profitability.

The impact of these investments has been quite lousy so far; other than some round tripping transactions to create fake revenue and balance sheet growth, these ai investments, while tremendously expensive, have not paid off:

- Microsoft's CoPilot has been a complete failure, consumers are not buying CoPilot pcs, and the CoPilot app has a 2.3 star rating on the Windows store. They are also facing regulatory pressure in Europe over Recall.

- Google's AI is providing dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation to users of its search engine, such as incorrect advice about prescriptions.

- Amazon's ""Go"" stores were supposed to use ML/AI to handle checkouts, when in reality, the AI failed to handle most of the work, and the remainder was just outsourced to human operators in India which struggled to keep up with the workload.

- Tesla has still failed to implement full self driving, and during its robotaxi event, had human actors control the robots to fake them being AI controlled.

- Google's Waymo is very impressive from a technology standpoint, but its hardware costs and regulatory barriers make it unlikely to achieve profitability, even as it expands.

Despite the poor results of AI investments so far, all of the top 10 holdings in the S&P500 other than Berkshire Hathaway trade at very high P/E Ratio, suggesting that very high earnings growth is priced in.

Even if AI will have a significant impact on the economy and society, the economics of it are not favorable to investors due to the high capex costs involved. Tech is no longer an industry where a team of 10-20 engineers can build a product that brings in Billions in revenue, with minimal hosting costs. It is now an industry where Billions of capital expenditures are needed just to build a model, and margins on the finished product are very poor.

Of course, tech CEOs realize this; which is why Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google are all working to replace Nvidia hardware, which sells at a huge markup, with their own in house chips. This is a tremendous threat to Nvidia's long term prospects.

Given the high expectations implied by elevated price to earnings ratios, and the poor financial performance of AI applications, it does seem quite unlikely that large caps will continue to outperform.

Small cap value and international stocks are almost certainly a better investment; if AI does drive significant productivity improvements, then labor heavy businesses will benefit from improved margins from using these products that large tech companies are offering.

Looking at small cap value funds like AVUV, and international stock indexes, there are a tremendous amount of labor intensive businesses with low margins in these funds that would benefit from AI/ML. Net margins going from 3% to 10% due to improved productivity would mean earnings more than tripling.

This has historically been the case with technical revolutions. For example, railroads revolutionized our economy and drove tremendous economic growth, but they provided terrible returns to shareholders.",0,14,1729227781.0

Why do you guys even bother trading when you can just buy the S&P 500?,"I’m genuinely curious. I’m not trying to dog on any of yall. I’m sure some of you have made a lot of money on individual stocks.

But like… I struggle to understand why you guys even bother. I just don’t see a point in investing in single company stocks.

They’re too volatile, companies change, etc. for instance Cisco used to practically be a monopoly. Now I’m not even sure it’ll reach the ATH from 20 years ago… ever. 

Also all of the time invested. Time is money… you really gotta research a lot before even considering buying stocks. 

So why not just go S&P 500, bonds, 401k, etc. it’s going great for me (130k net worth at 25.) 

Just curious, thanks. ",2164,1269,1729216235.0
"Intel seeks billions for minority stake in Altera business, sources say","Intel is looking to sell at least a minority stake in its Altera subsidiary that would raise several billion dollars in cash for the struggling firm, according to people familiar with the matter. This move that would represent a sharp about face from its earlier public messaging about the larger company’s prospects.

The storied semiconductor firm has made overtures to a number of private equity and strategic investors this week, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak freely about confidential information. Intel has expressed to some of those investors that it would be possible to acquire a majority stake in the Altera business, which was valued at $16.7 billion when Intel acquired it in 2015, said one of the people.

Intel is looking for a deal that values Altera at around $17 billion, said the people.

A representative for Intel did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment. The sale process represents an abrupt about-face from Intel’s prior commentary on Altera, where as recently September its CEO said that Intel’s leadership considered the business to be a core part of Intel’s future.

Intel has previously said that it could look to monetize its Altera business via an initial public offering, possibly as soon as 2026. But the idea of taking strategic or private equity investment would be a marked acceleration of those plans.

CEO Pat Gelsinger and his leadership team have previously said that Intel understands its disadvantaged position and is working aggressively to remedy it. To be sure, the sale of a minority stake in Altera would allow Intel to more easily pursue its semiconductor fabrication ambitions and assuage investors that it has a strong path forward as an independent company.

But the sale process also comes as Qualcomm has expressed interest in acquiring its onetime rival, a deal which would face fierce regulatory scrutiny and reshape semiconductor industry. Intel has to grapple with a significant debt load, and has seen its stock plunge more than 50% year-to-date.

"Google CEO names new search and ads boss, slides predecessor to chief technologist","Google is replacing Prabhakar Raghavan, the company’s search and ads boss, with longtime Google executive Nick Fox.

The move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.

“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai wrote in the post. “In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”

The move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.

Fox has long been a member of Raghavan’s leadership team. He will be leading Google’s Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company’s search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.

A Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president for product and design for the company’s Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company’s ads business unit.

“Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google’s AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,” Pichai wrote.

Raghavan led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because “things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,” CNBC reported.

Additionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google’s Gemini app, which includes Google’s AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.

“Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,” Pichai wrote.

The move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit “so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they’re building for,” Pichai wrote.

European Stocks,"Good evening everyone!

Do any of you guys have European stocks as a significant part of your portfolio? I am worried that mainly owning American stocks and ETFs puts me at a massive risk in case of a downturn. Especially considering the P/E ratios of American stocks are much higher than those of their European counterparts at the moment.

Would you consider buying some European (mainly Dutch, Danish and so) stocks in order to reduce your exposure to a potential heavy drop in American stocks? Or do you think in such scenario European stocks would drop just as much? In that case, the (expected) lower gains of European markets up to that point would mean owning them was not worth it.

Thank you very much in advance!",41,111,1729186217.0
Uber has discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia,"Uber discussed a bid for travel booking company Expedia, CNBC confirmed, in a deal that would push the ride-share company into new markets beyond car travel and food delivery.

The talks were in early stages, according to a person familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named since the talks are confidential. It remains unclear if an acquisition will take place. Expedia is familiar territory for Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who previously served as CEO of the travel group from 2005 to 2017. Khosrowshahi is still a non-executive member of Expedia’s board.

Uber has a market cap of around $168 billion, greater than its pandemic peak of around $112 billion, when customers were trapped indoors and relied on food deliveries. Shares fell in 2022 as the company struggled with high gas prices, inflation and bringing more drivers back to the platform. Its target, Expedia, is worth around $20 billion.

Uber’s interest in Expedia was first reported by the Financial Times.

Shares of Expedia were up more than 6% Thursday morning.

Expedia users can book flights, lodging, cars and activities through the company’s website, and it owns additional travel sites like Hotels.com, Vrbo and Orbitz. Expedia reported $28.8 billion total gross bookings in its second-quarter results in August.

An acquisition of Expedia would be a ”’major strategic home run” for Uber, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. He said this suggests Uber is going on offense and looking for new monitization opportunities, and it could be a step toward a “super app.”

“They have a massive mojo, and they’re just gaining more and more share,” Ives said. “I think they’re going to be on the hunt for M&A.”

Sanofi: Influenza and Covid-19 vaccine strategy at risk?,"Sanofi licensed the Matrix-M adjuvant from Novavax after Sanofis mRNA influenza vaccine development failed while Moderna succeded.

AGBA was previously trading as a penny stock from Hong Kong, which saw huge gains after the announcement of the merger, reaching at multiple points roughly twice the PPS that it was at before the recent string of good news (the lowest since April still being an order of magnitude above it's PPS prior to the initial announcement). As a Chinese stock, it's value was mainly propped up by the merger. **AGBA is now domesticating and moving it's headquarters to the USA in Delaware, and as a result is no longer a Chinese company.**

Triller was a private American corporation holding assets such as the **Triller app** (very similar concept to TikTok), Triller TV (a streaming service focused mainly on combat sports), and perhaps most valuable right now, is their majority stake in the **American Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship** (**BKFC**). Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2018, BKFC is the first promotion to hold an official state-sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in the United States since 1889. **Partly owned by** **Conor McGregor** as of April 2024, it's often claimed to be ""the fastest-growing combat sport in the world"".

Previous AGBA shareholders received a 30% stake in the combined company, while Triller private investors received the other 70%. Importantly, **there is a 165 day lock-up where that 70% of the outstanding shares cannot be traded.** Furthermore, the stated valuation of the combined company according to the merger agreement is **$4 Billion USD (\~$30 per share) - around eight times it's current value if it is to be believed**.

There is a ""strategic partnership"" between the merged Triller company and Yorkville (YA II PN, LTD), which will come into effect very soon, the terms of which are shown in this 8-K [here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001769624/000121390024059262/ea0208930-8k_agba.htm).

This will cause dilution, but it is also suspected that they are planning to leverage their power over the stock price to help pump it up significantly in order to get their money's worth and then some. They have not received any shares yet to my understanding, and are likely still holding down the stock's value to get an ideal entry point for at least a few days post-merger. It's not known with certainty, but it's suspected that Yorkville holds a very large short position on this stock, in part to keep the value down for their entry price, but potentially to also manipulate the value upwards after they buy-in by closing those short positions. This would offset the effect of dilution that their sales would have, and if timed right, may even trigger short squeezing and retail FOMO.

There has also been a great deal of hype regarding a **likely TikTok ban** which may come into effect in **mid-January**. The Triller app being a potential alternative to TikTok based in the USA puts it in a good position for massive growth following such a ban, especially if it can be improved using the combined assets of these merged companies. **Barring any delays, this catalyst would take place within the 165 day lock-up window of 70% of this stock's outstanding shares.**

The combination of these factors could spell out a very significant rally for $ILLR in the near future.

I'm currently holding 746 shares at a $4.95 average. My position has been at a 20-30% profit multiple times within the past couple weeks leading to the merger.

*ASML reports early*

&#x200B;

*In a report on Tuesday, ASML, which is based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided.Net bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said — well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations coming in at 7.5 billion euros.The company’s CEO warned of cautiousness among customers and said a “recovery is more gradual than previously expected.”After ASML tanked 16%, other global chipmakers plunged. Nvidia fell 4.7% and AMD lost 5.2%.Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that that Biden administration officials had discussed limiting sales of advanced AI clips from Nvidia to certain countries in the interest of national security, further dampening investor sentiment around the semiconductor sector.ASML has faced a tougher business outlook in China due to U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on its shipments.CFO Roger Dassen said Tuesday that he expects the company’s China business to show a “more normalized percentage in our order book and also in our business.”“So we expect China to come in at around 20% of our total revenue for next year,” he said. In its June-quarter earnings presentation, ASML said that 49% of its sales come from China.ASML’s business in Asia is likely to face continued headwinds, Eugene, Hsiao, head of China equity strategy at Macquarie Capital, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Wednesday.While “it makes a lot of sense” for ASML to continue working with China from the “economic perspective”, he said, there are “broader issues between governments going into economic problems.”*",10,10,1729095356.0
Talk me out of loading up on $WOLF—2nd edition.,"I’m back. Earlier this year, I made a similar post looking for bear cases on Wolfspeed before ignoring all of them and losing a bunch of money. While I may have been too early in hindsight, the fundamental situation is unchanged.

What has changed is an announcement yesterday that Wolfspeed will be receiving $750MM via the CHIPs act. The best bear case I heard last time was that China would subsidize and subsequently beat the shit out of WOLF. As I speculated, the US has now stepped up to say not so fast. 

A pop is happening now based on the news, but I am more interested in discussing a 2-3 year time horizon and the potential for shares to get into the $150 range.

So bears, where you at? Why can’t this company achieve $3b in annual revenue and profit margins in the mid 20% over the next 2-3 years without overly diluting or succumbing to high debt burden? From my perspective, they have crossed the chasm and done the hardest parts already, but where am I wrong?",0,11,1729093672.0
"United Airlines plans $1.5 billion share buyback, beats estimates for Q3","United Airlines said Tuesday that it is starting a $1.5 billion share buyback as the carrier reported higher-than-expected earnings for the busy summer travel season and forecast strong results for the last three months of the year.

Shares of the airline were up roughly 9% in morning trading Wednesday, heading for their highest close since February 2020, before Covid-19 was declared a pandemic.

United expects to earn an adjusted $2.50 to $3.00 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $2.00 a share a year earlier and the $2.68 analysts polled by LSEG estimated.

Here is what United reported for the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on average estimates compiled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $3.33 adjusted vs. $3.17 expected

Revenue: $14.84 billion vs. $14.78 billion expected

The share buyback would be United’s first since before the Covid-19 pandemic. U.S. airlines received more than $50 billion in government aid during the pandemic travel slump that prohibited share repurchases and dividends, though airlines were still fighting for financial stability.

Southwest Airlines announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program last month.

“Like other leading airlines and companies, we are initiating a measured, strategic share repurchase program,” United CEO Scott Kirby said in a note to staff on Tuesday. “Importantly, my commitment to you is that investing in our people and our business will always be my top priority even while we institute this share repurchase program.”

For the third quarter, United posted revenue of $14.84 billion, up 2.5% from a year earlier and above analysts’ estimates. It reported net income of $965 million, down 15% from a year ago.

United said domestic unit revenue was positive in August and September compared to last year as airlines trimmed a glut of flights that were pushing down fares. United expanded capacity by 4.1% in the third quarter. The carrier said corporate revenue rose 13% in the quarter; premium revenue, including business class tickets, rose 5%; and sales from its no-frills basic economy tickets were up 20%.

The airline last week unveiled a far-flung expansion for next year that included new flights to Mongolia, Senegal, Spain and Greenland in a chase for international travel demand.

Adjusting for one-time items, United reported earnings per share of $3.33, topping Wall Street forecasts and United’s estimate in July of $2.75 to $3.25 a share.

Airline executives will hold a call with analysts at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday and will likely face questions about demand for the end of the year and into 2025, as well as production problems at Boeing, where most factories have been idled during a more than monthlong machinist strike.

United’s flight attendants’ union, which hasn’t yet reached a new labor agreement with the company slammed the airline’s decision to resume buybacks.

In a statement, Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents crews at United, Spirit, Alaska and other carriers, said: “That money United just promised Wall Street belongs to Flight Attendants who worked throughout the pandemic and during this taxing recovery for all of us on the frontlines.”

Questions about company received RSUs.,"I am still under educated in the world of stocks and have a few questions. I appreciate any and all help!

1. When selling RSUs I receive through my place of employment, how does the taxation work? Is it a simple capital gains tax on the increase of value since the day it officially vested or from the day I was awarded them and then made to sit through a vesting cycle? For example: I was awarded 55 RSUs in September of 2021 but they didn't vest, and enter my portfolio, until May 2022, Would those gains be from the September 2021 or May 2022?

  
2. If you sell multiple shares of stock and some have been yours for over a year and some not, are long term and short term capital gains taxes figured for each unit sold or is it a package deal? Are you able to choose which ones to sell individually or does it automatically choose FIFO or the opposite?

3. I have an account with Fidelity for my RSUs. Is there a way to see the length of time each RSU has been in my portfolio?

"Amazon goes nuclear, to invest more than $500 million to develop small modular reactors","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html

Amazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.

AWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.

An SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.

Amazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.

""We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,"" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. ""Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.""

Virginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.

Dominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.

""Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,"" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. ""Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.""

AWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.

""These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,"" Garman added.

Amazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.

Under the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.

The SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.

""Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,"" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. ""To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.""

Last spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.

Qualcomm Said to Wait for US Election to Decide Intel Move,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) is likely to wait until after the US presidential election in November before deciding whether to pursue an offer to buy Intel Corp. (INTC), people familiar with the matter said.

San Diego-based Qualcomm wants greater clarity on the new occupant of the White House before deciding its next move because of the impact any future administration would have on the antitrust landscape and America’s relationship with China, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

Qualcomm could opt to wait until after the inauguration of the new US president in January before deciding how to proceed, given the many complexities of a potential transaction involving Intel, some of the people said.

A combination of Qualcomm and Intel, whose products are key to the digital framework supporting everyday life — from smartphones to electric vehicles — would almost certainly draw intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the US and around the world. That includes China, a key market for both Qualcomm and Intel.

Qualcomm made a preliminary approach to Intel on a possible takeover of its struggling rival in September. In the same month, the company made informal inquiries with antitrust regulators in China to gauge their stance on any potential deal, some of the people said. Qualcomm hasn’t received any feedback from Chinese authorities, which are waiting to see if the company actually makes a formal bid, they said.

Intel is at the heart of the US government’s plan for a homegrown chipmaking renaissance, making the political backing for any deal crucial. The Biden administration has consistently framed the importance of its chipmaking policy in national security terms. Intel is in line to get the biggest allocation of funding under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, if it goes ahead with all of its factory building plans. Qualcomm has been speaking with US regulators and believes an all-American combination could allay any concerns, people familiar with the matter have previously said.

Making a bid after the election may bring other advantages for Qualcomm. Intel will report third-quarter earnings later this month. If that follows the pattern of the disappointing announcement of three months ago and the impact it had on the potential target’s stock price, it could make a deal considerably less expensive for Qualcomm. This time around, analysts are predicting another net loss in excess of $1 billion for Intel.

Qualcomm’s deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty that the company will decide to pursue an offer for Intel and the timing could change, the people said. Representatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment, while the State Administration for Market Regulation in China didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, Intel has been working on an expensive plan to remake itself and bring in new products, technology and outside customers. As part of a recently announced shakeup, Intel intends to turn its programmable chip division into a standalone business and sell shares to the public or seek an investor for it.

Apollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel, Bloomberg News reported last month, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and a possible alternative to any takeover by Qualcomm.

Boeing to Sell at Least $10 Billion in Shares to Plug Cash Drain,"*source:* [*https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1*](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-needing-cash-moves-to-sell-new-shares-fce4c116?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

[Boeing](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) [BA -](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BA) is moving to raise at least $10 billion by selling new shares in a bid to stabilize its increasingly precarious finances.

The jet maker, in a pair of regulatory filings on Tuesday, told investors it could issue up to $25 billion in shares or debt during the next three years while also entering into a new credit agreement with lenders.

Under the shelf registration, Boeing is expected to pursue a stock offering that raises around $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

A [strike by Boeing’s largest union](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-strike-workers-reasons-explained-589c245e?mod=article_inline) is exacerbating financial woes at the jet maker, which last turned a profit in 2018. Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.

Boeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate. 

The new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.

“These are two prudent steps to support the company’s access to liquidity,” Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.

Credit-rating firms have warned that the company needed to raise capital and that its debt could be downgraded to junk status.

The company on Friday said it would [cut roughly 17,000 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-to-cut-10-of-workers-delay-new-plane-394370d5?mod=article_inline) and warned of deeper losses as production of most planes, including its bestselling 737, [is halted](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-strike-union-workers-walk-off-af5703df?mod=article_inline) amid a machinists’ strike under way since Sept. 13.",418,128,1728999042.0
Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal,"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Nvidia closes at record as AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3.4 trillion,"Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.

Nvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.

Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.

Of the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.

Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.

Nvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.

With a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.

I think a second explanation, overlooked, is that the stock market is pricing in the possibility that DJT pivots to a new business, either a new social network or some partnership that is worth billions. DJT gets free advertising from Twitter and media coverage of Trump. So Trump can launch a new product and not have to advertise. Advertising is a huge expense for any business.

For those wondering if we're in a bull market.... ,"COST, a high volume retail store, trades at 50x forward earnings while CRWD, which literally brought the country to a halt a few months ago, trades at 75x forward earnings.  Both have PE/G ratios over 3 (1 is considered fair value).

The total market cap of the S&P is 2.0x US GDP (vs. historical norm: 0.75x-1x) while the P/E 10, i.e., Shiller's CAPE, is over 100% above its arithmetic mean and over 120% above its geometric mean.

While the US will continue to ""quiet"" default through non-stop printing, total government debt to US GDP recently surpassed 100%, which suggests it's only a matter of time before the bond markets start to push back with higher rates at the long end of the yield curve.

**The Federal Reserve may have pretty much just hit its 2% inflation target**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/the-federal-reserve-may-have-pretty-much-just-hit-its-2percent-inflation-target.html)

*Key Points*

* *This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its 2% objective, a mark that Goldman Sachs thinks the central bank may have already hit.*
* *From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting interest rates.*

&#x200B;

*This week’s inflation data provided more evidence that the Federal Reserve is nearing its objective, fresh on the heels of the central bank’s dramatic interest rate cut just a few weeks ago.*

*Consumer and producer price indexes for September both came in around expectations, showing that inflation is drifting down to the central bank’s 2% target.*

*In fact, economists at Goldman Sachs think the Fed may already be there.*

*The Wall Street investment bank Friday projected that the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04% when it is released later this month.*

*If Goldman is correct, that number would get rounded down to 2% and be right in line with the Fed’s long-held objective, a little over two years after inflation spiked to a 40-year high and unleashed an aggressive round of interest rate hikes. The Fed prefers the PCE as its inflation gauge though it uses a variety of inputs to make decisions.*

*“The overall trend over 12, 18 months is clearly that inflation has come down a lot, and the job market has cooled to a level which is around where we think full employment is,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said in a CNBC interview Thursday after the latest consumer price data was released. “We’d like to get both of them to stay in the space where they are right now.”*

&#x200B;

*Some obstacles ahead*

&#x200B;

*While keeping inflation at bay may not be an easy task, the latest data indicates that though prices are not receding from their troublesome heights of a few years ago, the rate at which they are increasing is pulling back.*

*The 12-month rate for the all-items consumer price index was at 2.4% in September, while the producer price index, a proxy for wholesale inflation and a leading gauge for pipeline pressures, showed an annual rate of 1.8%.*

*Goldman’s projection that the PCE index is heading to 2% is also about in line with tracking from the Cleveland Fed.*

*The central bank district’s “inflation nowcasting” dashboard pegs the 12-month headline PCE rate at 2.06% for September, which would get rounded up to 2.1%. However, on an annualized pace, inflation for the entire third quarter is running at just a 1.4% rate — well below the Fed’s 2% goal.*

*To be sure, there are some caveats to show that policymakers still have some work to do.*

*Core inflation, which excludes food and energy and is a metric that the Fed considers a better measure of longer-term trends, is expected to run at a 2.6% annual rate for the PCE in September, according to Goldman. Using just the consumer price index, core inflation was even worse in September, at 3.3%.*

*Fed officials, though, see the unexpectedly high shelter inflation numbers as a major driver of the core measure, which they figure will ease as a lower trend in rents works its way through the data.*

*Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sept. 30, addressing the rent situation, said he expects housing inflation to continue to recede while “broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*

*From a policy standpoint, lower inflation opens the door for the Fed to keep cutting rates, particularly as it turns its attention to the labor market, though there’s some trepidation about how quickly it should move.*

*September’s half percentage point reduction to a fed funds range of 4.75% to 5% was unprecedented for an economy in expansion, and the Fed at the very least is expected to return to its normal quarter-point pace. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic even said Thursday he’d be open to skipping a move altogether at the November meeting.*

*“Aggressive easing would risk spiking consumer demand just as it is settling into a sustainable pace,” PNC senior economist Kurt Rankin said in a post-PPI analysis. “This result would in turn put pressure on businesses to meet that demand, re-igniting gains in those businesses’ own costs as they jockey for the necessary resources to do so.”*

*Futures traders are betting on a near certainty that the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at both the November and December meetings.*",449,200,1728809095.0

"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla’s ‘toothless taxi’ fails to excite investors","Tesla’s hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber’s ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday’s event — particularly slumping in early August and mid-September — but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber’s stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla’s shares are plunging during Friday’s trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla’s highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company’s failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

“TSLA’s toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,” Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Posting this just to see if my train of though is wrong and really just to ask a question. Before I get to my question, some context. I'm 25 years old and reside in a European country that uses Euro as its main currency. I currently have just under $40K in VOO which makes up 50% of my portfolio. The other 50% is in individual stocks.

So I've been investing in the S&P500 index for the past 6 years or so through VOO and have only recently come across VUSA. The main feature that attracted me to VUSA, is the fact that I will not need to exchange my euros to dollars in order to invest in the S&P500. With the way I currently invest in the S&P500 through VOO, I am exposed to fluctuations between the dollar and the euro, and I would much rather not have that added risk.

My question is, would it be a good decision to keep the current position I have in VOO and simply move the amount I invest in my portfolio every month to VUSA instead? My plan would be to continue to invest what I do monthly into VUSA instead of the VOO, and reinvest the dividends made from both funds into VUSA.

The reason I do not want to sell my VOO position and reinvest it in VUSA is because at this point in time, the S&P500 is at an all time high, and I would much rather not have my average cost be at the current highs the fund has hit and just start averaging in from now.

What do you think would be best to do in this situation?

Thanks in advance to anyone who comments!",0,22,1728681028.0
"Boeing to cut 17,000 jobs as losses deepen during factory strike","Boeing will cut 10% of its workforce, or about 17,000 people, as the company’s losses mount and a machinist strike that has idled its aircraft factories enters its fifth week.

Boeing expects to report a loss of an $9.97 a share in the third quarter, the company said in a surprise release on Friday. It took charges in both its commercial airplane unit and defense business.

The manufacturer also won’t deliver its still-uncertified 777X wide-body plane until 2026, putting it six years behind schedule, and will stop making commercial 767s in 2027, CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a staff memo on Friday afternoon.

“Our business is in a difficult position, and it is hard to overstate the challenges we face together,” Ortberg said. “Beyond navigating our current environment, restoring our company requires tough decisions and we will have to make structural changes to ensure we can stay competitive and deliver for our customers over the long term.”

The job and cost cuts are the most dramatic moves to date from Ortberg, who is just over two months into his tenure in the top job.

He was tasked with restoring Boeing after safety and manufacturing crises, but the labor strike has been the biggest challenge yet for Ortberg. Credit ratings agencies have warned the company is at risk of losing its investment-grade rating, and Boeing has been burning through cash in what company leaders hoped would be a turnaround year.

S&P Global Ratings said earlier this week that Boeing is losing more than $1 billion a month from the strike, which began Sept. 13 after machinists overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement the company reached with the union. Tensions have been rising between the manufacturer and the union, and Boeing withdrew a contract offer earlier this week.

Transfer agent requirements ,"Hi. I am Per Rep in a deceased family member's estate.

Posted here awhile back about my probate attorney holding onto paper stock certificates  for over a year with no information obtained. Advice was to get the certs back, which I finally did, and fire him. I also did do that as well but for a reason outside of the paper stock certs and this issue was far more serious.

Now I am currently consulting with different attorneys for the rest of probate proceedings. It's going to be a bit of time to decide.

I found all the transfer agents for the paper stock certificates on my own and with your help, so thank you. I need to get account balance summaries for these, especially because the Inventory posted by the (now former) attorney doesn't include them. However, all the transfer agents require court papers dated within 90 days.

My domiciliary papers are from December of 2023.
In my state, domiciliary papers are only issued once and are not renewable.

Should I submit the packets to the transfer agents with my court papers as-is or should I wait to find a new attorney and have them go through the process of obtaining new domiciliary papers? I don't need anything other than valuation determinations at this time.

Scrutiny on single use plastics - is Ball Corporation (world's largest aluminum can maker) a play?,"Hi all, had some thoughts I'd like to sanity check when considering buying into Ball Corporation, world's largest maker of aluminum cans, as there is more trend to avoiding plastics for both environmental and health reasons (IE Microplastics).

I'm noticing more and more the emergence of aluminum bottles for waters and the like in stores around me. Nothing revolutionary, but I definitely notice them more.

Here's an example:

* [https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/united-center-chicago-bulls-and-chicago-blackhawks-eliminate-all-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-with-culligan-international-as-the-new-official-water-partner](https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/united-center-chicago-bulls-and-chicago-blackhawks-eliminate-all-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-with-culligan-international-as-the-new-official-water-partner)

There is also some handwaving in the general direction of the problem of single use plastics by the US Government, including phasing out on federal property by the 2030's and elimination by 2040. Will it happen? Probably not, but the handwaving is there. 

For instance:

* [https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-phase-out-single-use-plastic-federal-operations-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-phase-out-single-use-plastic-federal-operations-2024-07-19/)

So I also note that Ball Corporation - who make these lovely mason jars I use every now and then for making tomato sauces and the like - are the world's largest manufacturer of Aluminum cans. So I suppose my question is, can they make more of them and will the company be a long-term play? 

* The make over 112 billion cans a year according to this Redditor [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b6orak/til\_that\_ball\_corp\_famous\_for\_its\_mason\_jars\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b6orak/til_that_ball_corp_famous_for_its_mason_jars_is/)

There are a few other players in this space, but Ball is the one I hear the most about. They also were dabbling in Aerospace for a hot minute there, but they've sold out of that to focus on their core packaging business. 

I've only done a quick scan, the numbers don't look like lighting the world on fire right now, and they had a few revenue misses. But... I'm open to hopping in given the above.

Would love some thoughts.",28,23,1728668753.0
Tesla is Completely out of Touch with Needs of Taxi Services. ,"Seeing a lot of focus on the Temu Boston Dynamics bot, but not a lot of discussion on the robo taxi. 

How this thing is built tells me how out of touch and unprepared Tesla is to seriously compete in ride servicing. 

First off this thing has two seats, that alone is such a dumb design decision. It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. 

One other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

Beyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. 

What are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. 


Edit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? 
Still a toy.
 
Also, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.

And even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. 

My opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.",773,435,1728665139.0

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",1700,566,1728649167.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Morgan Stanley just met with Nvidia’s CEO and came away even more confident in its top pick,"Source according to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/10/morgan-stanley-just-met-with-nvidias-ceo-and-came-away-even-more-confident-in-their-top-pick.html) ([archive](https://archive.ph/WQiAK)): 

* Nvidia remains at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation, with new opportunities to gain market share, Morgan Stanley said.

* Analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight rating on the chipmaker and said meetings with Nvidia’s CEO and other management reinforced the firm’s view that it is the top pick in semiconductors. Morgan Stanley hosted the company for a three-day nondeal road show this week.

* “We remain very bullish longer term, but would concede given the rally that shorter-term upside from here raises the bar on earnings somewhat,” Moore said in a Thursday note to clients. His $150 price target implies about 13.1% potential upside for the stock, which has skyrocketed nearly 167% this year.

* “This is still an exceptional situation, with AI the most important trend in technology, and NVIDIA unquestionably the biggest beneficiary of those investments,” he said.

* Long-term confidence in Nvidia’s growth remains high, the analyst said. Management highlighted opportunities in evolving generative AI inference that will scale exponentially involving “long thinking” — or inference interactions that require substantially more computation. Moore explained that these tasks will require a “much richer mix of hardware” that will provide Nvidia with a new avenue for growth.

* “NVIDIA’s upcoming rack scale products as an optimal solution,” Moore said. “The longer term vision is that deep thinking will allow every company in the world to hire large numbers of ‘digital AI employees’ that can execute challenging tasks,” he added.

* According to Moore, Nvidia’s Blackwell systems NVL36/72 are the optimal solution for those challenges, as he believes they provide a more capable processor to the AI markets, with the GB200 systems potentially being the most important innovation as they have a “full rack” approach. Under that approach, Nvidia enables 36 or 72 GPU racks to simultaneously communicate with other graphics processing units, enhancing the ability to treat the entire rack as one massive system.

* “Our view continues to be that NVIDIA is likely to actually gain share of AI processors in 2025, as the biggest users of custom silicon are seeing very steep ramps with NVIDIA solutions next year,” Moore said.

* The analyst is also confident that the Blackwell rollout is on schedule, with orders booked out roughly 12 months, which also drives strong short-term demand for Nvidia’s Hopper GPU architecture.

* “In the shorter term, the Blackwell ramp appears to be quite strong, with no major changes to the roadmaps and every indication that business remains robust with very high forward visibility,” Moore said.",252,60,1728587091.0

AMD is looking to get a bigger piece of the massive budgets being thrown toward artificial-intelligence hardware. Nvidia Corp. is by far the market leader, but analysts see room for multiple companies to win given the size of the opportunity.

Su seemed to hint at that in her keynote presentation. “There’s no one company that has every answer,” she said, noting that AMD hopes to stand out in part through its embrace of open industry standards.

Companies need “the right compute for the right applications,” she said, adding that AMD has “the best portfolio in the industry to address end-to-end AI,” in her view.

"TD Bank faces $3 billion in penalties as part of US settlement, WSJ reports","Canada's TD Bank is expected to pay about $3 billion in penalties as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators and prosecutors over charges it failed to properly monitor money laundering by drug cartels, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The bank's U.S. unit is expected to plead guilty on Thursday to the charges, the report said on Wednesday.

TD Bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

As part of the agreement, the bank's primary U.S. regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), is also expected to impose an asset limit barring the Canadian lender from growing above a certain level in the country, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Both the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) are planning to put independent monitors in place to watch the lender closely and ensure compliance with the pacts, the report said.

The FinCEN monitor is expected to be in place for four years, the WSJ reported, citing one person familiar with the matter.

The settlement will include the DOJ, the FinCEN, OCC and the Federal Reserve among which the Justice Department will take the biggest slice of the penalties amounting to about $1.8 billion with the FinCEN getting $1.3 billion, the report said.

Spokespeople for the DOJ, the OCC and the FinCEN did not respond immediately to Reuters' requests for comment.

AMD AI event on Oct 10: Any expectations?,"I haven't seen any update about AMD able to improve their supply issues to improve MI300 cards, nor do I see wide adoption. A few months ago couple ""AI Datacenter"" startups shared stage with AMD about their new offerings with MI300 but some of them have quietly embraced NVDA and abandoned AMD due to poor supply.

No good news which highlights how META uses these cards and any performance benefits in training or inference on MI300. Azure and OCI clouds have some regions with few MI300 compute instances but I have not seen any customer success stories using these vs using Nvidia older generation T4, A100 and H100s. 

State of ROCm is not bad. It's improving and many have written blogs and KB articles on how Llama3 models are running without issues on MI300 cards. I read some articles of using Mistral as well. However, AMD still isn't able to demonstrate end to end solutions.

Who feels optimistic about AMD and they able to grab at least 5% of AI market in next 2 to 3 years at this snail pace? What are you expecting from tomorrow's AMD AI event?

What, if any, are the grown prospects for AMD in AI era with limited supplies for MI cards?",31,10,1728528055.0
TSMC Earnings Ahead: Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs?,"With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price. 

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!

**Fed officials were divided on whether to cut rates by half a point in September, minutes show**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/09/fed-officials-were-divided-on-whether-to-cut-rates-by-half-a-point-in-september-minutes-show.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/09/fed-officials-were-divided-on-whether-to-cut-rates-by-half-a-point-in-september-minutes-show.html)

&#x200B;

*Federal Reserve officials at their September meeting agreed to cut interest rates but were unsure how aggressive to get, ultimately deciding on a half percentage point move in an effort to balance confidence on inflation with worries over the labor market, according to minutes released Wednesday.*

*The meeting summary detailed reasons that policymakers decided to approve a jumbo rate cut of 50 basis points for the first time in more than four years and showed members divided over the economic outlook.*

*Some officials hoped for a smaller, quarter percentage point cut as they sought assurance that inflation was moving sustainably lower and were less worried about the jobs picture.*

*Ultimately, only one Federal Open Market Committee member, Governor Michelle Bowman, voted against the half-point cut, saying she would have preferred a quarter point. But the minutes indicated that others also favored a smaller move. It was the first time a governor had dissented on an interest rate vote since 2005 for a Fed known for its unity on monetary policy.*

*“Some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes stated.*

*“Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved,” the document added. “A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization.“*

*Since the meeting, economic indicators have showed that the labor market is perhaps stronger than officials favoring the 50 basis point move had expected.*

*In September, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, much more than expected, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%.*

*The data has helped cement expectations that while the Fed likely is in the early days of an easing cycle, future cuts likely would not be as aggressive as the September move. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in recent days have backed the expected 50 basis points in cuts indicated by the “dot plot” unofficial forecast released after the September meeting.*

*The minutes noted that the vote to approve the 50 basis point cut came “in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks” against the labor market. The minutes noted that a “a substantial majority of participants” favored the larger move, without specifying how many were opposed. The term “participants” suggests involvement of the full FOMC rather than just the 12 voters.*

*The minutes also noted that some members favored a cut at the July meeting that never materialized.*

*Though the document was more detailed about the debate over whether to approve the 25 basis point cut, there was not as much information about why voters supported the larger move.*

*At this post-meeting news conference, Powell used the term “recalibration” to sum up the decision to cut, and the term also appears in the minutes.*

*“Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants’ assessments of the appropriate path,” the minutes stated.*

*Such a recalibration would bring policy “into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market.” Supporters of the 50 basis point cut “also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks.“*

*Under normal circumstances, the Fed prefers to cut in quarter-point increments. Previously, the Fed moved by half a point only during Covid and, before that, the 2008 financial crisis.*

*Market pricing is pointing to the fed funds rate ending 2025 in the 3.25%-3.5% range, about in line with the median projection of a 3.4% rate, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch. Futures markets previously had been indicating a more aggressive path and in fact now are pricing in about a 1-in-5 chance that the Fed does not cut at its November 6-7 meeting.*

*The bond market, though, has been acting differently. Since the Fed meeting, both the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields have surged about 40 basis points.*",39,26,1728497065.0
Why I Think There’s an 85% Chance the Market Goes Up Tomorrow After CPI Data,"With the CPI data set to be released tomorrow, I'm feeling optimistic about the market's potential to close in the green. Here’s why I believe there's an 85% chance the market will rise following the CPI announcement:  
  
Projected Inflation Rates: Analysts are forecasting a year-over-year CPI increase of around 2.3%, which would be a significant drop from previous months

If this prediction holds true, it signals easing inflationary pressures, which typically boosts investor confidence.  
Market Sentiment: Historical trends suggest that when CPI data comes in lower than expected, markets, particularly the Nasdaq, often react positively. A lower inflation rate might lead to speculation that the Federal Reserve will take a less aggressive approach to interest rate hikes.

This sentiment could drive up stock prices as investors shift their focus back to growth opportunities.  
External Factors: Recent trends show declining energy prices, which have contributed to lowering overall inflation​.

If these trends continue and align with the CPI data, it could further reinforce a bullish outlook among traders.  
Earnings and Economic Indicators: Positive reports from the labor market and other economic indicators support the idea that the economy is on solid footing.

  
If the CPI data confirms this narrative, we could see a substantial market rally.  
Of course, nothing is guaranteed in the markets, but the combination of favorable CPI projections, historical market responses, and supportive economic conditions gives me a strong sense of optimism.  
  
What do you all think? Are you expecting a green day for the market tomorrow?

Boeing withdraws contract offer after talks with union end without a deal,"Boeing withdrew a contract offer for 33,000 machinists who have been on strike since mid-September, and said further negotiations ""do not make sense at this point.""

The machinists walked off the job on Sept. 13 after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal, halting production of most of Boeing's aircraft, which are made in the Puget Sound area. Boeing later sweetened the offer, increasing pay raises, a ratification bonus and other improvements, which the union turned down, arguing that it was not negotiated.

Talks again broke down this week, meaning the strike will continue. The stoppage will cost Boeing more than $1 billion per month, S&P Global Ratings said Tuesday as it issued a negative outlook for the aerospace giant's credit ratings.

Stephanie Pope, CEO of Boeing's commercial aircraft unit, said the company improved contract pay during talks this week but said the union didn't consider the proposals.

""Instead, the union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business,"" Pope said in a staff note.

The union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said Tuesday that Boeing refused to improve wages, retirement plans and vacation or sick leave.

We have caused concerns about our fundamental technological competitiveness and the future of the company due to our performance falling short of the market’s expectations. Many people are talking about Samsung’s crisis. We, who are leading the business, are responsible for all of this.

> Customers, investors, and employees. Samsung, however, has always turned crises into opportunities, having a history of challenge, innovation, and overcoming. We will definitely make the dire situation we are currently facing an opportunity for a leap forward. Our management will take the lead in overcoming the crisis.

> Above all, we will restore our fundamental technological competitiveness. Technology and quality are our lifeblood. It is Samsung Electronics’ pride that we can never compromise on. Rather than short-term solutions, we will secure fundamental competitiveness. Furthermore, I believe that only new technologies that do not exist in the world and perfect quality competitiveness are the only ways for Samsung Electronics to make a comeback.

> Second, we will prepare for the future more thoroughly. We will rekindle our unique passion to pioneer the future without fear and to cling to our goals until the end and achieve them. We will re-arm ourselves with a challenging spirit to run toward a higher goal, rather than a defensive mindset to protect what we have.

> Third, we will look again at our organizational culture and working methods and immediately fix what needs to be fixed. We will rebuild our traditional organizational culture of trust and communication. If we find problems in the field, we will expose them as they are and have fierce discussions to improve them. In particular, we will actively communicate with our investors whenever we have the opportunity.

> Dear customers, investors, and employees.

> If we fiercely challenge ourselves, we are confident that we can turn the current crisis into a new opportunity. Please give us your support and encouragement so that Samsung Electronics can once again demonstrate its strength.

"Deep dive into Starbucks - Optimized for choice, not profit.","**1.0 Introduction**

Starbucks isn't just a coffee chain; it's a place where your drink comes with a version of your name on the cup. While this small detail doesn’t change the quality of the product, it has a big impact on customers:

1. **Personalization** - People naturally crave recognition, and this simple interaction taps into that need, making the experience feel more personal, even if it is just a name on a cap.
2. **Customer engagement** - Calling out names for orders, often with humorous misspellings, creates a memorable experience that extends beyond the store. Countless social media posts about these misspellings have gone viral, and this kind of engagement works to Starbucks' advantage.

The customer-centric culture is what allowed the company to grow to almost 40,000 locations worldwide (\~18,000 in the U.S.).



**2.0 The struggle**

Starbucks is perceived as a company with a strong brand.

***But is that true?***

***What does it mean?***

***What does a strong brand bring to the table?***

A strong brand has **pricing power**. It can charge premium prices and raise them in an inflationary environment, **without experiencing a decline in the quantity of products (or services) sold.**

The revenue formula for a company of this kind is simple:

**Revenue** = **Quantity of products sold** x **Price.**

Over the last decade, there have been some inflationary times.

Based on Finance Buzz, Starbucks increased the prices of their products by 39%, the lowest among the chains included in the research. This is slightly above the inflation rate, so it can be argued that the company managed to fully pass the costs to the final customer.

However, the second part of the equation was the **quantity.** A company with strong pricing power should not experience a decline in the amount of products (or services) sold. Unfortunately, this isn’t true for Starbucks.

The company has experienced lower revenue for two quarters in a row compared to the same quarters in the prior year. Their comparable store sales have decreased, meaning they **bring less revenue per store despite the price increase.** **This isn’t a characteristic of a company with a strong brand and pricing power.**

The CEO at the time, Laxman Narasimhan had a terrible CNBC appearance after the Q2 results. His explanation for the poor results was “***We didn’t communicate the value we provide***” - Which I find ridiculous. I don’t think the reason for the poor results is a lack of communication.

But, it gets worse. In the quarterly, release, there was a section related to the strategic priorities. The one that caught me by surprise was **“Become truly global”.** What does this even mean? Isn’t a company with \~40,000 locations “global” enough?



**3.0 The actual reasons for the struggle**

So, what is happening? **Why is Starbucks struggling?** While studying the company in depth, I’ve identified the following 4 reasons:

1. **More is not always better** - The menu continues to expand, offering more options and customizations. When the orders start shifting away from standard to customized, it leads to longer times to prepare a beverage. This leads to **fewer drinks** being prepared (and sold) per hour and **longer waiting times**. From a financial point of view, the cost per beverage goes up, and then it is passed on to the final customer. However, why should the customers pay more? What changed? For many, the waiting time increased. Ultimately, many customers (including loyal ones) decided that the current value for money offered by Starbucks wasn’t worth it, and looked for alternatives.
2. **China's competitive landscape** - As the second-largest market, it decreased a 14% in the latest quarter. The local rivals have been undercutting Starbucks in price.
3. **Mobile app disappointment** - Mobile orders account for roughly a third of Starbucks’ U.S. orders. This leads to a lot of customers simultaneously waiting for their orders, with overwhelmed baristas trying to keep up with it. However, there is also another psychological aspect. The total waiting time comprises **order time** & **preparation time.** Most customers remember “waiting” as the time between ***placing the order and receiving the beverage***. With mobile apps, the order is done without having to wait in line and although the total waiting time is the same, the preparation time is longer. Reducing the order time isn’t a benefit that stands out.
4. **Worsening reputation** - In 2021, employees started organizing and forming a labor union, motivated by concerns over workplace conditions, wages, unpredictable schedules, and overall job security. Starbucks has been accused of using aggressive tactics to prevent unionization, via anti-union messaging, store closures and firings, and even increased surveillance and intimidation. As of 2024, the company continues to face legal challenges from the NLRB (“National Labor Relations Board“) and ongoing unionization efforts.



**4.0 The solution (?)**

On August 13th, 2024, Starbucks announced that Brian Niccol has been appointed chairman and CEO of Starbucks, starting September 9th, 2024.

This is been seen as part of Elliott Management’s activist campaign.

**Brian Niccol is the 4th CEO of Starbucks in the last 3 years.**

The share price was up 24% on this announcement, which shows the market sentiment of this decision. Brian has been the CEO of Chipotle since 2018 and the CEO of Taco Bell before that. He has extensive experience in operations and is expected to bring new energy and ideas.

There will be plenty of similarities between his past roles and this one, especially focused on improving efficiency and cost-reduction, given his experience in digital improvement and online/mobile app ordering.

On September 10th, his 2nd official working day, he shared a letter to all partners, customers, and stakeholders with 4 key areas of focus:

1. **Empowering the baristas to take care of the customers**
2. **Get the morning right, every morning** by delivering outstanding drinks and food, on time, every time.
3. **Reestablishing Starbucks as the community coffeehouse** committing to elevate the in-store experience, ensuring the spaces reflect the sights, smells, and sounds that define Starbucks.
4. **Telling the Starbucks story**

In addition to this, he mentions that investments in technology are being made, to enhance the customer experience, improve the supply chain, and evolve the app and mobile ordering platform. His comment on China is that the company needs to *understand the potential path to capture growth and capitalize on its strengths in this dynamic market.*

He’s also addressing that in some places, especially in the U.S. the menus can feel overwhelming, the product is inconsistent, the wait is too long and the handoff too hectic.

In my opinion, this short letter of 2 pages, does a great job of addressing all the key challenges the company is facing (as outlined above).

Finally, there’s someone who takes responsibility, points out exactly what is going wrong, and not only hints at what is coming next but has experience in doing this before. To me, it seems that **Starbucks found the right person**.

This is also why if everything goes according to plan, he’s getting a compensation package above $100m.

But it is not going to be easy, nor fast. Changes of this kind will take time, especially given the size of the company. It would not be unreasonable to expect the first meaningful changes in 2-4 quarters.



**5.0 Valuation**

Given everything above, it doesn't come as a surprise that the company’s operating margin has decreased from 17% to 15% (over the last decade).

The company is still a cash machine bringing over $6 billion in cash from operations (with a limited Share-based compensation of \~$300m).

One of the key questions is - Given what is known today, how much is the company worth? I’ll give Brian the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he can implement the best automation tools to help baristas, get the menu under control, and bring the operating profitability to \~19%, which is optimistic.

At the same time, I’ll assume the growth will continue more or less at the same pace as the last few years but will be decelerating over time.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $99b **($88/share),** slightly below today’s share price of $96.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue in 10 years & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|15%|17%|19%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|79% ($65.3b)|$54|$65|$75|
|110% ($76.5b)|$63|$76|$88|
|126% ($82.4b)|$68|$81|$94|

Historically, Starbucks was always trading at a premium, as it was perceived as a company with strong brand and pricing power (hence, lower risk). I’d argue that right now, it doesn’t deserve that premium.

The market is already pricing a turnaround story.

Bayer shares drop 7% after U.S. court announces review of Monsanto case,"Shares of German life sciences company Bayer fell nearly 7% on Wednesday, after a U.S. court said it would review a case alleging that exposure to products of the company’s Monsanto unit harmed individuals.

The Washington Supreme Court this week accepted a review of litigation against the German company over the impact of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposure at the Sky Valley Education Center in Washington state, one of many related cases Bayer is fighting. Previously, an appeals court had overturned a $185 million award in the trial after finding flaws in the case in May, according to Reuters.

Bayer shares were 6.76% lower at 12:45 p.m. London time, putting the stock on course for its worst performance since March and extending a loss of 13% in the year to date. Shares had tumbled more than 30% last year amid challenges including ongoing litigation over the Monsanto unit and high net debt.

The company said in a statement Wednesday that there was “no basis for a different outcome on appeal,” and that it believed the Washington Court of Appeals’ decision had identified three errors in the case, including that testimony for the plaintiffs regarding PCB exposure lacked scientific validity.

Bayer argues the claims relate to industrial materials which Monsanto voluntarily ended manufacture of in 1977.

Bayer acquired U.S. agrichemical-maker Monsanto in 2018.

The deal has led to the company fighting myriad legal challenges in various U.S. courts over alleged negative health effects, including cancer, from exposure to Monsanto products including Roundup weed killer.

According to Reuters, around 125,000 charges have been brought against the product in the U.S., more than half of which had been resolved following a $10.9 billion settlement in 2020.

In September, the company secured a legal win when the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found in its favor in a claim that Monsanto violated state law by failing to add a cancer warning to the Roundup label.

**About Pemvidutide**  
Pemvidutide is a novel, investigational, peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of obesity and MASH. Activation of the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors is believed to mimic the complementary effects of diet and exercise on weight loss, with GLP-1 suppressing appetite and glucagon increasing energy expenditure. Glucagon is also recognized as having direct effects on hepatic fat metabolism, which is believed to lead to rapid reductions in levels of liver fat and serum lipids. In clinical trials to date, once-weekly pemvidutide has demonstrated compelling weight loss, robust reductions in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, liver fat content and blood pressure. The U.S. FDA has granted Fast Track designation to pemvidutide for the treatment of MASH. Pemvidutide recently completed the MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial and is being studied in the ongoing IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial.

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

Month-over-month TSM's revenue rose 0.4% as it had generated NT$250.87B in revenue in August.

TSM is slated to report its third quarter results on Oct. 17.",95,26,1728466344.0

Bloomberg: US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Monopoly Case Remedy,"The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.

In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.

The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.

The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

Antitrust enforcers said Google gained scale and data benefits from its illegal distribution agreements with other tech companies that made make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers.

Mehta, who ruled this summer that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets, plans to hold a trial on the proposed remedy next spring and issue a decision by August 2025. Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta’s decision, but must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so.

Google’s Android business encompasses the operating system used on smartphones and devices as well as apps.

On Monday, a different federal judge ordered Google to open up its app store for the next three years to resolve a separate antitrust case related to its dominance of app distribution on Android smartphones. The company also plans to appeal that decision.

Roblox: Inflated Key Metrics For Wall Street And A Pedophile Hellscape For Kids,"[https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/)

Hindenburg just put out their latest short report, and it features none other than everyone's favorite ~~parenting substitute~~ child-oriented gaming platform Roblox. In a way the allegations are unsurprising to anyone that's been following this company, but this goes WAY more in depth than anything that has come out before.  
  
Summary bullet points from the beginning of the article:

*  Roblox is a $27 billion online gaming platform headquartered in San Mateo, CA. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is led by founder and CEO David Baszucki.
* The company has reported net losses every quarter since becoming a public company, with last twelve months (LTM) losses totaling $1.07 billion. Its stock trades at 8.6x sales, a 57% premium to gaming peers, pricing in expectations of rapid future growth and profitability.
* Insiders have cashed out $1.7 billion in stock since the company’s 2021 direct listing. In the last 12 months, insiders have sold \~$150 million in stock, including \~$115 million by CEO Baszucki personally.
* Since Roblox isn’t profitable, its stock price (and, in turn, insiders’ ability to dump hundreds of millions of dollars of stock) is reliant on the growth metrics it presents to Wall Street.
* Our research indicates that Roblox is lying to investors, regulators, and advertisers about the number of “people” on its platform, inflating the key metric by 25-42%+. We also show how engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%+.
* Since prior to going public, Roblox has reported the number of “people” on its platform in dozens of official investor communications. Among many examples, Roblox wrote in a 2022 quarterly report, “there are over 54.1 million **people** coming to Roblox every day”.
* Our findings show that the company’s reported number of “people” regularly matches Roblox’s reported Daily Active Users (DAUs).
* But DAUs, according to Roblox’s own disclosures, “are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox” because they can include numerous accounts run by a single person, such as alternate or bot accounts.
* Given these definitions, we believe Roblox intentionally conflates “people” with DAUs, consistently inflating the reported number of people on its platform.
* In 2023, Roblox told the SEC it is “unable to identify if a user has multiple accounts”. The company’s response to the SEC appears to be a flat out lie.
* Multiple former employees told us that Roblox does internally track single users with multiple accounts, referring to the process as ‘de-alting’.
* Interviews reveal Roblox effectively has two sets of books for counting users: one for internal business decisions, in which multiple accounts are ‘de-alted’, and one used by the finance team that reports higher metrics to investors.
* “If that number \[DAUs\] is not de-alted, I think the actual one would be like anywhere between 30 to 20 percent lower”, a former data scientist told us.
* Roblox forums detail how users regularly have dozens of alternate accounts to “farm” for goods on Roblox, avert bans and increase their follower counts, among other reasons.
* In addition to alternate accounts, bots are rampant on the platform. For example, Roblox’s 7^(th) most popular game, Adopt Me!, has garnered over 83,000 [Change.org](http://Change.org) signatures to remove it from the platform due to extensive “botting” that “breaks” Roblox.
* Roblox’s 2^(nd) most visited game, Blox Fruits, was dominated by traffic from Vietnam, where we found numerous Facebook groups, including 5 with 50,000 to 117,000 members each, advertising and soliciting tools to run 20+ Roblox bot tabs at a time.
* A former data scientist told us that activity in Vietnam “inflated a lot of our numbers. Like crazy, insane, in terms of engagement, DAU\[s\]”.
* In addition to inflating the reported number of “people” on its platform, we also suspect Roblox massively inflates a second key metric, “engagement hours”. The company reported an extraordinary 2.4 average hours of engagement per day per user in 2023.
* This level of engagement is 58% higher than the average time spent by U.S. 8-12 year olds playing all mobile games (including tablet), according to a 2021 survey, and 26%-166% more time than leading social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.
* To better understand the company’s reported engagement, we hired a technical consultant that monitored the top \~7,200 Roblox games across \~2.1 million Roblox servers, collecting 297.7 million rows of real-time player data.
* The data suggests that Roblox could be massively overstating the true level of user engagement across its platform: our review of an average of 30.4 million unique daily users found they spent just \~22 minutes in games per day.
* Further analysis of play times showed numerous games in which obvious bot accounts remained in-game for more than 24 hours straight. Our representative sample flagged millions of ‘zombie’ engagement hours that can majorly skew Roblox’s reported “average” engagement.
* Roblox incentivizes developers to create ‘AFK’ (Away From Keyboard) games that artificially inflate engagement by tying developer pay in part to engagement. Web forums detail developer strategies for creating features that encourage bots and zombie engagement.
* We think Roblox can and should report its estimated de-alted and de-botted metrics so that investors, advertisers, and regulators can be better informed about the actual number of “people” on the platform, and their genuine level of engagement.
* Beyond inflated key user metrics, our in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.
* Roblox is compromising child safety in order to report growth to investors, per our interview with a former senior product designer: “If you’re limiting users’ engagement, it’s hurting your metrics…in a lot of cases, the leadership doesn’t want that.”
* For the second quarter of 2024, in a push toward profitability, Roblox reported a 2% year-over-year decline in its trust and safety expenses.
* Core to the problem is that Roblox’s social media features allow pedophiles to efficiently target hundreds of children, with no up-front screening to prevent them from joining the platform.
* For example, in 2018, prior to Roblox going public, a 29-year-old was caught by police with 175 hours of video footage of him grooming and engaging in explicit behavior with 150 minors using online platforms, namely Roblox.
* Media and non-profit exposés from 2020 to July 2024 revealed digital strip clubs, red light districts, sex parties and child predators lurking on Roblox. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation in 2024 labeled Roblox “a tool for sexual predators, a threat for childrens’ safety”.
* Numerous criminal indictments from 2019-2024 allege that sexual predators groomed children in-game, ranging from 8-14 years old, then kidnapped, raped or traded sexual content with them.
* Following years of scandals, we performed our own checks to see if the platform had cleaned up its act. As a test, we attempted to set up an account under the name ‘Jeffrey Epstein’…only to see the name was taken, along with 900+ variations.
* Many were Jeffrey Epstein fan accounts, including “JeffEpsteinSupporter” which had earned multiple badges for spending time in kid’s games. Other Jeff Epstein accounts had the usernames “@igruum\_minors” \[I groom minors\], and “@RavpeTinyK1dsJE” \[rape tiny kids\].
* We attempted to set up a Roblox account under the name of another notorious pedophile to see if Roblox had any up-front pedophile screening: Earl Brian Bradley was indicted on 471 charges of molesting, raping and exploiting 103 children. The username was taken, along with multiple variants like earlbrianbradley69.
* After we found a username, we listed our age as “under 13” to see if children are being exposed to adult content. By merely plugging ‘adult’ into the Roblox search bar, we found a group called “Adult Studios” with 3,334 members openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors.
* We tracked some of the members of “Adult Studios” and easily found 38 Roblox groups – one with 103,000 members – openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography.
* The chatrooms trading in child pornography had no age restrictions. Roblox reports that 21% of its users are under the age of 9, a number that is likely underestimated given that Roblox has no age verification aside from users seeking 17+ experiences.
* Registered as a child, we were also able to access games like “Escape to Epstein Island” and “Diddy Party”. We found over 600 “Diddy” games, including “Survive Diddy” and “Run From Diddy Simulator”.
* Since September 2nd, 2024, third-party monitor ‘Moderation For Dummies’ has reported \~12,400 erotic roleplay accounts on Roblox. These include everything from “rape/forceful sex fetishes” to underage users “willing to do anything for Robux”.
* Users seeking sexual experiences on Roblox are so pervasive that there are thousands of Roblox sex videos on porn sites, inviting users of unknown ages to make explicit content on the platform.
* We tested out Roblox’s experiences to see what else kids were being exposed to. We quickly encountered images of male genitalia and hate speech in Roblox’s “school simulator” game, which had registered 28.9 million visits with no age restrictions.
* Despite the company’s mission “to connect a billion users with optimism and civility”, we found games such as “Beat Up Homeless Outside 7/11 Simulator”, which had 1 million visits and 15,000 favorites before being removed from Roblox.
* Nonetheless, Roblox users identifying as 9 years old and up can still beat up homeless people in “Beat Up People Outside of 7/11” with over 900,000 visits.
* In the game “Beat Up The Pregnant”, users hacked pregnant women to death in a Wal-Mart parking lot with machetes or killed them with frying pans or a selection of guns.
* We played “\[GUNS\] Work at a Hospital” where users can go on a hospital shooting rampage. The game has \~1.6 million visits and remains on the platform with no age restrictions. The game’s thumbnail is a picture of a terrified pregnant woman.
* “LGBTQ+ Vibes” is a game available to all ages that has accumulated over 40.6 million visits and over 224,000 favorites. Users regularly described lewd sex acts while others used hateful slurs.
* “Palestine And Israel Hangout” allows kids of all ages to purchase bombs and knives and attack each other. This game has \~13 million visits and \~7,200 favorites and remains on the platform.
* Posing as a child in Roblox’s “therapy” experience, our therapist introduced himself as a “rapper with only one p”. We were advised to run away from home and that he would come pick us up so we could move into his basement in exchange for paying rent with our body.
* Some games seem to encourage illicit interactions, like “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe” and “XYZ Club Vibe” with 31 million collective visits. Both are available to users who self-identify as 9+ years old, who can simulate sex in bathrooms wearing skimpy outfits.
* Other Roblox users have identified issues of simulated rape, naked users, and rampant in-game sexual harassment.
* Despite Roblox’s claims of “best in the world” content moderation, our interviews with moderators show safety was largely outsourced to Asian call centers. Moderators described being paid $12 a day to review countless instances of child grooming and bullying with a limited ability to keep perpetrators off the platform permanently.
* Compounding all of the above issues, Roblox faces saturation in its top markets like the U.S. and Europe. It is now attempting to keep the appearance of growth alive by adding loss-generating users in markets like Asia, per a former employee. Profitability has plummeted despite reporting higher user metrics.
* The conversion rate of new daily active users to paying users has been in steady decline since 2020. Roblox is now hoping to drive incremental growth by pitching advertisers that \~79.5 million “people” spend an average of 2.4 hours per day on the platform.
* As noted earlier, we suspect these metrics are wildly inflated and that the platform poses major reputational risks for advertisers. For instance, we found Instagram ads in the same school simulator game with Nazi hate speech and photos of male genitalia.
* Overall, we think Roblox has adopted the Silicon Valley approach of ‘growth at all costs’, whether by misleading or outright lying to investors about its key metrics or by opening its platform to dangerous predators and illicit content unsuitable for children.",202,42,1728407375.0
Trading Around a Core Position,"I do short term stock trading. I typically swing trade. But, sometimes I'll do a day trade also. Regarding trading around a core position. Say for example, you initiate a core position at $75/share. Then it goes to $65, and you add more. When it gets to $85, is it more common and/or better to sell the $75 shares or the $65 shares? If I had to guess, I would say that selling the $75 shares would be better because then you have lowered the cost basis on your core position to $65.

"How to access historical data for NASDAQ stocks from 2019, including Volume, VWAP, EMAs, SMAs, and Level 2?","Hello everyone!

As the title says, I’m wondering if it’s possible to access historical data from 5 years ago for NASDAQ stocks. Specifically, I want to analyze trades from May 2019 to December 2021. For each trade, I have the exact date and either the opening and closing price or the opening and closing time. I need to view 1-minute and 5-minute charts with data on Volume, VWAP, and sometimes EMAs and SMAs. For some trades, I also need Level 2 data, as well as access to Pre-Market and After-Hours data.

From what I’ve seen, TradingView offers only 40,000 historical bars even on their most expensive plan, which isn’t enough. To make matters worse, many of the traded stocks are either bankrupt, merged, or have moved to the OTC market.

I use IBKR and can access some data there, but they don’t have an option to jump directly to a specific date on the chart. This means I have to scroll manually for an hour to find the right period, and when I change the time frame, I have to start over...

I’m even open to coding my own software for viewing charts, but I’m not sure where to find the data. Additionally, I’d like to test stock scanners for those periods to find parameters that would have identified the exact stocks on the exact dates.

Does anyone have experience with this? Any suggestions would be very helpful.",4,2,1728391998.0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Samsung posts worse-than-expected guidance for third quarter,"South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said it expects worse-than-expected profit for the third quarter.

In guidance released Tuesday, the world’s top memory chip maker said operating profit for the quarter ending September is projected to be around 9.10 trillion won, marking a surge from last year’s 2.43 trillion Korean won.

Analysts polled by LSEG expected an operating profit of 11.456 trillion Korean won ($7.7 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Samsung’s revenue for the quarter was expected to hit 81.96 trillion won ($61 billion), according to LSEG estimates.

Samsung is the leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are utilized in devices like laptops and servers. It is also the world’s second largest player in the smartphone market.

“The company needs to remain flexible about its memory supply control, since the downfall of conventional DRAM will likely hurt Samsung more than its smaller rivals,” Macquarie Equity Research analysts said in a recent note.

Samsung had instructed its subsidiaries around the world to reduce 30% of staff in some divisions, Reuters reported in September, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter.

Why dont stock charts show true returns (with dividends?),"Am I crazy or just uneducated - but why in the world dont all stock charts (google finance, yahoo, bloomberg, TV, newspapers, etc) show TRUE returns on investments - including dividends?

Wouldnt charts that show growth with dividends be a lot more useful for the reader?

For example, if you look from 1/1/2010 to now..  
SPY with dividends invested return: 13.66%  
SPY without dividends invested return: 12.46%

CVX (Chevron) is 7.1% vs 8.6% (thats 21% different!!)

The whole point is to see how much your money would have grown if you had invested it - and not including dividends makes you miss out on quite a bit of the full story!

Not just that - it makes stocks that give dividends appear less attractive on the charts when you are comparing to other stocks.

Are there websites / resources that show stock returns with dividends reinvested? I feel like I would be picking a lot more stocks with dividends that could be hidden gems as their actual return is far higher than would appear at a glance on traditional charts!!!",63,27,1728345239.0

The next group of wonderful distributor stocks (BECN amongst others),"Distributors are amazing stocks. I’m looking for the next group of smaller cap industrial stocks that can replace the existing group of distributors that are now at high multiples.

distributors that i love but are too expensive include:

Ferguson $FERG +140% in 5yr, 23x PE, 40bn mkt cap
WWGrainger $GWW +240% - 27x , $50bn
Fastenal $FAST +90%, 35x, $40bn
There are others..


Why i love distributors:
1) Capital light
2) often consolidating fragmented markets through small roll-up m&a (often mom and pop competitors)
3) Route density is a great and easy way to improve margins. 
4) often distribute critical parts that are also low cost. customers willing to pay for good service

I’m looking for the next group of industrial distributors. $BECN , $BLDR $WCC all seem interesting.. but BECN feels ripe

Beacon Roofing $BECN $6bn and on 14x PE
Beacon 

1) Capital light distributor of roofing and other housebuilding products
2) rolling up fragmented market through small m&a
3) technology is becoming differentiator vs small competitors
4) Brad Jacob’s $QXO is looking to do a deal in the building products space. hopefully BECN isn’t the target
5) ongoing buyback (on its way to becoming a stock cannibal)
6) near term beneficiary from hurricanes..

US judge orders Google to open up app store to competition,"A U.S. judge on Monday ordered Alphabet's Google to overhaul its mobile app business to give Android users more options to download apps and to pay for transactions within them, following a jury verdict last year for “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.

The injunction by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco outlined the changes Google must undertake to open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including making Android apps available from rival sources.

Donato's order said that for three years Google cannot prohibit the use of in-app payment methods and must allow users to download competing third-party Android app platforms or stores.

The order restricts Google from making payments to device makers to preinstall its app store and from sharing revenue generated from the Play store with other app distributors.

Google and Epic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alphabet shares were down nearly 2% following the ruling. Donato said Epic and Google must establish a three-person technical committee to implement and monitor the injunction. Epic and Google each get a pick, and those two members will select the third person.

Epic’s lawsuit, filed in 2020, accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for in-app transactions.

The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a jury in December 2023 that Google unlawfully stifled competition through its controls over app distribution and payments, paving the way for Donato's injunction.

Google had urged Donato to reject Epic’s proposed reforms, arguing they were costly, overly restrictive and could harm consumer privacy and security. The judge mostly dismissed those arguments during an August hearing.

“You’re going to end up paying something to make the world right after having been found to be a monopolist,” he told Google's lawyers.

In a separate antitrust case in Washington, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Aug. 5 ruled for the U.S. Justice Department and said Google had illegally monopolized Web search, spending billions to become the internet’s default search engine.

Google also began a trial in September in Virginia federal court in a Justice Department lawsuit over its dominance in the market for advertising technology.

Google has denied the claims in all three cases.

"Super Micro soars after company says it's shipping over 100,000 AI GPUs per quarter","Super Micro Computer shares jumped 15% after the computer server company said it’s shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence per quarter.

That could translate into several billions of dollars of orders if the average price of a GPU is around the cost of Nvidia’s $30,000 chip. The GPU figure was revealed in an announcement about a new cooling product unveiled by Super Micro on Monday.

As one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, Super Micro makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage, websites, AI training models and more. The company said its new cooling product will allow data centers to spend less on hardware costs and cooling infrastructure for servers that typically need to be running constantly.

Super Micro also said it recently deployed more than 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling solution “for some of the largest AI factories ever built,” as well as other cloud service providers.

While the announcement was cheered by Wall Street, Super Micro is about nine weeks behind in reporting its annual report, which was expected in August. The company said late that month that management needed additional time “to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024.” 

Even after Monday’s rally, the stock is down by well over 50% since peaking in March. Shares fell 12% on Sept. 26, after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice opened a probe into the company following a report from short-seller Hindenburg Research in which the firm alleged it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.”

Shell Plc - What are your thoughts?,"
This one caught my eyes, because I'm a believer in the *Great Rotation*, and sooner or later, over-coverage fatigue will set-in with A.I and tech stocks. Not to mention, the power hungry data centers can't be fueled alone with solar or wind. Traditional energy is here to stay. This is also a good diversifier in tech-heavy portfolios (that we all have).

I'm also a half-believer in *energy transition* bandwagon. This (should) sound like almost a propaganda to anyone with analytical mind of 12 year old. Renewables are fine as a ""top-up"" source or to smooth out peak demands. EVs - where do they get their power from? Much of logistics, happening with trucks and ships, still remains dependent on oil & gas. It's plain science. A battery simply won't have enough juice to pull a truck load or power a ship across oceans. Just one litre of fuel packs more than 10 units of energy (3 hour charge at 3 KW).

Now specifically for Shell Plc, a few things caught my eyes -

1. Q3 guidance and better refining margins outlook
2. Expected severe cold winter in Europe 
3. $3.5B buyback and juicy 4% dividend yield 
4. Historically low valuation, with rising crude/gas prices ",7,9,1728314328.0

Robotaxis are here and the public is divided. Alphabet owned Waymo is the leader in the space. Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch.,"Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. 

Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. 

Now Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.

The company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.

Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. 

Alphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.

Besides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.

Amazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. 

As driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",190,261,1728311606.0

Activist investor Starboard Value takes $1 billion stake in Pfizer (Reuters),"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake of about $1 billion in Pfizer (PFE), opens new tab and wants the U.S. drug giant to make changes to turn its performance around, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

Starboard has also approached Ian Read, a former Pfizer CEO, and Frank D'Amelio, who served as CFO until 2021, and both have expressed interest in helping the activist investor, the sources said.

Read served as CEO until Albert Bourla took the position in 2019. Bourla was instrumental in working with BioNTech to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

Pfizer declined to comment and Starboard did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Lowest Fed rate for 2025,"What is your expectation of FED lowest possible rate in 2025? I asking because there was a high expectation of FED rate cut in September with growing unemployment and inflation going down. Now we have:

* Unemployment rate declining in September is 4.1% (4.3% in July and 4.2% in August)
* Oil prices somewhat elevated in September and it is not clear where they will go from here, as they could decline if exporters increase production.
* Larger war could cause more inflation pressure because of potential global logistic issues.

This makes me believe that it would be hard to motivate FED to decrease rates much. Would you expect rate to go below 3% in 2025? I not see why would it happen.

If the assumption above is true, then companies benefiting on higher rates will still have significant advantage. Among them are payment systems (PAYO, WISE.LSE). While PAYO have core team located in Israel, their computing power is outside. The WISE.LSE seems more secure as they distributed among safer areas.

From other point retail construction heavily dependent on low rates. However the 2024 proven that those with strong balance sheet, low debt and good management have not suffered much of losses. There are few good companies in industry (like LEN or MHO) with PE less than 15. Taking into consideration the inflation would stay within 2-3% such PE seems good enough to consider them as investment, even though risk of FED rate could stay quite elevated is high.

Would love to hear opinions on FED rates or some related interesting companies examples.",52,25,1728249566.0
Google’s Grip on Search Slips as TikTok and AI Startup Mount Challenge,"[Google’s Dominant Search Business Is Under Attack From TikTok to AI - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/tech/online-ad-market-google-tiktok-9599d7e8?mod=tech_lead_pos2)

Short Summary:

  
Google’s share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to drop below 50% next year for the first time in over a decade

Opinions on Autodesk? (ADSK),"I think Autodesk is like the Microsoft of the built environment, providing critical software that engineers, product designers, and architects use as building plans become more digitally drawn, and the need for sustainable architecture demands more software intensive analysis of the conditions, and modelling complex geometries. AI in Architecture is also still in its early stages, and Autodesk has a plethora of software tools, not just 2d and 3d drawing/modelling.

Autodesk's softwares are widely used among engineering firms and architecture firms, and have a history, so there will be alot of switching costs and dependency on the software, making customers sticky.

Autodesk also has a business model which provides free educational license accesses to their software in architecture/engineering schools, this makes students dependent on the software from the very start.

Autodesk is also a widely known industry standard for building blueprints, yes there is Sketchup, Rhino, and Grasshopper, but they are more specialised for product design, interior design, and parametric building facades which can also be exported to Autodesk's Revit to then be used in the 3d modelling there.

The above 3 points boast a very strong moat for Autodesk in my opinion.

Im an architecture student, and I dont hold any position in Autodesk yet but I most likely will in the future.

TL;DR : Microsoft of the built environment, moat of dependency, industry standard for building blueprints, AI in architecture is still early, demand for digital software to improve efficiency and sustainability of planning buildings/cities/products",37,12,1728203498.0

Whats your take on RDDT?,"Possibly a bit biased from posting this on reddit but reddit stock but it's been one of the few ipos in recent years that been performing well since inception. 

Idk about you but I tend to use reddit to find answers or opinions more than any other platform. Besides that marketing/ad revenue can be a real show stopper to continue growing if done right (cough meta and google)

I do see that the valuation is a bit rich with a p/s of 10x compared to something like meta and it's been around for 19 years so ita questionable if they can actually grow the way they should post ipo to be profitable.

Imo the reach for new users will continue to grow faster and faster thanks to their agreement with Google and OpenAi.

Today I looked at my stocks at 4:30 (fully 30 minutes after market close) and I was up 1.37% and just looking at it now I am up 1.35%.  The dollar value shifted ever so slightly as well.

This is not due to after hours trades and it usually only moves a very small number of basis points (usually less than five in either direction).

Can anyone explain this?",0,21,1728092561.0
Is it Time to Sell DOCN? A Perspective from a Fan,"# TL;DR

I like DOCN as a company, however I don't think it's a good stock to own for value-minded investors because I realized recently that it does not have clear/profitable competitive advantages and it's own financials do not scream that its a value play compared to stocks that I own (GOOGL, PYPL, unfortunately NET) and the three alternatives (WBD, LULU, HOOD, WEN) that I would want to own. The following is my argument for why this is a stock better suited for mass diversification rather than for stock picking.

Now that I think about it, I should've sold before I posted this. Oh well. Edit: Managed to close @ 42.85 on October 7th (Good till cancel limit order).

# Business Analysis

I have been very partial towards DigitalOcean for the last few years even when it was trading in the $100s. Back then it seemed that many people (myself included since I was naive) did not understand the true value of these tech growth stocks. Only a few years later do we see the true valuations for some of these stocks.

I opened a position in March of this year due to being a DOCN customer myself. However in the last month, I started having doubts on whether DOCN is worth including in a individual stock portfolio of \~20 ""undervalued"" stocks. At one point, I was down 10%, and now I'm up 11% which is better than my benchmark $MORT which has returned 7% during this time.

The reason I've changed my mind about DOCN is not actually due to anything they've done incorrectly. It doesn't matter that they are operating financially well, it doesn't matter how nice their products are, it doesn't matter that I personally prefer using DOCN to other platforms, it doesn't matter that they care about small businesses, it doesn't matter how cost effective they are \[1\]. The reality is that DOCN competes in an environment with many competitors and substitutes. The barrier to entry is embarrassingly low as we see serverless competitors (substitutes to VPS) like Vercel and Netlify which don't even buy hardware but people do end up spending more on them just because they choose to use JavaScript as a backend and didn't know how much performance a $5/month VPS can provide. These serverless companies rent from AWS, offer their solutions on top, and sublet at a margin. Then there are the very cost effective market (serverhunter) so competing on price alone is how we get perfect competition. Lastly, there are the behemoths of the industry: AWS, Azure, GCS, Shopify (I believe every shopify storefront is hosted on Shopify), Alibaba Cloud, etc. which are more expensive, less intuitive (excluding Shopify, and I don't know if its true for GCS or Baba Cloud), but offer some complex ready to use solutions (e.g. [live streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/live-streaming-on-aws/) which Kick uses). Given that there are so many competitors that target basically every requirements a business may have (cost, solution, simplicity), I find it hard to use ""competitive advantage"" as justification to own DOCN unlike owning GOOGL. So that really leaves the question whether DOCN is currently undervalued on its own merits:

# Financial Merit Compared to My Alternative Holds and Buys

P/E is over 60, Beta over 1.5, QoQ growth has been 2-4% last 3 quarters. FCF market cap yield is 3% compared to:

* 0.64% at Cloudflare which has a competitive advantage, however not actually worth owning for value investors
* 3% at Google (which is a mature & profitable company)
* 8.26% at PYPL (which has less competition in the payments space, is profitable, and has been around longer)
* Even LULU has 5% FCF yield and the short-term bull case for that is China.
* WBD with 33% FCF yield; this is the stock I will be buying with the proceeds
* HOOD: had a high FCF yield in March

Which stock is hidding in plain sight?,"Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.

Now that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be ""hiding in plain sight"" today.

A lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.

Personally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the ""Magnificent 7."" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.

Amazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.

Any stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.


tldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership.

Thoughts on AXP,"Hi guys,

First a disclaimer : I am a total newbie, so forgive me for the dumb questions.
Couple of weeks ago somebody posted about AXP and why they believed AXP was a good company to invest in. I didn’t buy at the time but kept an eye on the stock. Since then the stock kept going up and I keep reading good comments about the level of service AXP is providing to its customers. 
P/E ratio is lower than Visa and Mastercard, Revenue and Margins are up vs 2023. Yet, when I look at analysts stock objective consensus on IBKR, I see the stock is already well above the consensus which I find confusing.
So my question is : do you guys believe AXP still has room to go higher ?

**Mortgage rates spike after stronger-than-expected jobs report**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/mortgage-rates-jobs-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/mortgage-rates-jobs-report.html)

*Key Points*

* *The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage is now 6.53% according to Mortgage News Daily.*
* *That is 42 basis points higher than the day before the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point.*

&#x200B;

*The average rate on the 30-year-fixed mortgage jumped 27 basis points Friday morning following the release of the government’s monthly employment report. The rate is now 6.53%, according to Mortgage News Daily.*

*That is 42 basis points higher than Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point. Mortgage rates do not follow the Fed, but they loosely follow the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.*

*For mortgage rates, it is all about what the expectation is next for the Fed. As such, there was a lot of anticipation leading up to this particular monthly report, since the last two pointed to weaker labor market conditions.*

*“Indeed, the Fed’s decision to cut by 0.50 vs 0.25 last month had much to do with the fear/expectation that reports like today’s would be in shorter supply going forward,” wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. “The only salvation here would be the notion that this is just one jobs report in a recent run that’s been mostly weaker and that perhaps the next one won’t be so damning for bonds.”*

*However, the report does shift the outlook slightly for rates going forward, since most had assumed the trajectory would be lower.*

*“MBA’s forecast is for longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, to remain within a relatively narrow range over the next year,” Mortgage Bankers Association’s chief economist Michael Fratantoni wrote after the jobs report was released. “This news will push mortgage rates to the top of that range, but we do expect that mortgage rates will stay close to 6% over the next 12 months.”*

*Today’s homebuyers are highly sensitive to rate moves, as home prices continue to rise from year-ago levels. There is also still very low inventory on the market, which has only served to keep prices higher. Rates are a full percentage point lower than they were a year ago, but the housing market has not seen much of a boost yet.*",34,6,1728065592.0
"Meta, challenging OpenAI, announces new AI model that can generate video with sound","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/meta-announces-new-ai-model-that-can-generate-video-with-sound.html

> Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Samples of Movie Gen’s creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people’s real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas. Movie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.

> In one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle. Videos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.

> The announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft -backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts. Technologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.",133,44,1728065569.0

* *The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*
* *“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*
* *The EU added that it was still working in China to look for “an alternative solution” even as the tariffs are adopted.*

&#x200B;

*The European Union on Friday voted to adopt definitive tariffs on China-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs).*

*“Today, the European Commission’s proposal to impose definitive countervailing duties on imports of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from China has obtained the necessary support from EU Member States for the adoption of tariffs,” the EU said in a statement.*

*It added that the decision marked another step toward the conclusion of the Commission’s anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles from China, which was launched in October 2023.*

*The EU first announced that it would slap higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports in June, on the grounds that they benefit “heavily from unfair subsidies” and posed a “threat of economic injury” to electric vehicle producers in Europe.*

*Duties were also disclosed for individual companies that linked to their levels of cooperation and information they supplied to the EU as part of the bloc’s probe into EV production in China.*

*Provisional duties were put in place from early July.*

*The European Commission then revised its tariff plans in September based on “substantiated comments on the provisional measures” from interested parties.*

*A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce told reporters that Beijing continues to believe that the investigation into China’s subsidies for its electric vehicle industry has come to “pre-set conclusions,” adding that the bloc is promoting unfair competition.*

*On Friday, the EU said it was still looking for other solutions, even as the tariffs are adopted.*

*“In parallel, the EU and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution that would have to be fully WTO-compatible, adequate in addressing the injurious subsidization established by the Commission’s investigation, monitorable and enforceable,” it said.*

&#x200B;

*Industry response*

&#x200B;

*German automakers criticized the EU’s decision.*

*Mercedes Benz called the tariffs a “mistake” and urged the European Commission to delay their implementation, while BMW said the move marked a “fatal sign” for Europe’s auto industry, Reuters reported. Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile called on the EU and China to continue talks about the issue, saying that an alternative solution was still possible, according to Reuters.*

*Swedish auto maker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Geely Holdings, said that it would “continue with our long-held strategy of building our cars where we sell them and have committed significant long-term investment into Europe,” according to a statement.*

&#x200B;

*Division in the EU*

&#x200B;

*The decision comes after months of debates and deliberations between EU member countries, which have expressed varying opinions on increasing tariffs on imported Chinese made EVs.*

*While France has been a big supporter, previously pushing the EU to start investigations of potential tariffs, Germany has advocated against them, raising concerns about consequences for its own struggling car makers.*

*German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Friday urged the European Commission not to start a trade war.*

*“Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen’s EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution,” he said in a post on social media platform X according to a CNBC translation.*

*Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Thursday his country would veto a proposal from the European Commission that puts forward tariffs of up to 45%, Reuters reported.*

*Potential retaliation from China has been a key concern for some EU members, especially as China has already launched anti-dumping probes into pork and brandy exports from the EU, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.*",235,165,1728037790.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

June 2026 - where will NVDA be?,"I was looking at the option chain of NVDA, to hedge my portfolio. Current P/E, P/S and most metrics point to stellar growth expectations. If that's the case, why is $200 Call for June 2026 priced 'just' at $15. $240 Call (double of current price) is trading at $10.

[NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/options/?date=1781740800) 

It's an almost certainty that NVDA should double in next 18 months, or even sooner. So why wouldn't someone just get this option for $10, and free up his $110 capital for something else?

I know, the option can become worthless if price stays below $240. But if I am getting into something as volatile as NVDA, I'm looking to 2X my capital; and not 'normal' 20-30% gains. So, isn't it better to just ""throw"" $10 at NVDA option, if the end-result is basically the same as investing $120 in it?",0,19,1728002341.0
Ideas for profiting on the decline of the American education and rise of social media brain rot?,"There are plenty of news about more and more students are below their grade level for reading skills and college tuition also continues to keep getting more expensive and more inaccessible. Toddlers are given tablets and screens before learning how to speak. Teachers are treated like minimum wage workers, overworked and underpaid considering the importance of their role in society.

It's not a situation that I look forward for, but I foresee the future to continue getting worse for the American education system. If so, I'd like to be able to afford my hospice care while my grandchildren stream my death on social media.

[Purchase Cost - (Dividends + Sales of Same Stock) ] / Shares = ?,"Not quite sure what this metric measures, but I was wondering. Let's say I have 100 shares of stock Z. Total purchase amount for all shares currently owned is $10,000. Total dividends received is $1,000. Total sales proceeds is $8,000 (let's say I bought and sold the same stock, taking advantage of cyclical changes). Adding that up, I've spent $10,000 and received $9000 (or $1000) for these 100 shares. Does that mean the new cost basis is $10 per share? I don't think that's the true cost basis, but I can't seem to find the correct term for what I'm calculating.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: “Demand for Blackwell is Insane”,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang indicated the demand for its latest GPU, Blackwell, remains on track.


""Blackwell is in full production,"" Huang said Wednesday during an interview with CNBC. ""Blackwell is as planned, and the demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.""


The Blackwell GPUs are already being released to data centers and industrial customers for artificial intelligence applications. They will be available for consumers in 2025.


""The thing that we have done with Blackwell, and what we have announced, is there is new Al infrastructure generation every year,"" Huang said. ""So, we're updating our platform every single year.

Levi Slumps After Paring Back Its Full-Year Sales Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Denim maker Levi Strauss & Co. narrowed its full-year revenue outlook to the bottom end of its previous range, sending shares down sharply in extended trading.  

Net revenue is expected grow about 1% in the company’s current fiscal year, compared with a previous range of 1% to 3%. Sales in the company’s fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 25, were slightly short of the average analyst estimate, while its Americas division posted a revenue decline in the period. 

The shares fell 8.1% at 4:47 p.m. in extended New York trading. The stock has gained 27% this year through Wednesday’s close, outpacing the advance of the S&P Total Market Index over the same period. 

Levi is making a push to generate more sales through its own channels. While the company is making progress on that front, its wholesale business is deteriorating, with a decline of 6% in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The company wants to use its own stores, website and app for sales as shoppers increasingly move away from the department stores that have traditionally been crucial for big apparel brands. 

Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company’s namesake brand is gaining ground, and touted “another great quarter of strength” for the company’s direct-to-consumer segment. That division, which includes Levi’s own website and stores, posted 10% growth. 

“The revenue miss is causing some knee-jerk pressure in the in the stock, but the core Levi’s brand performed well,” Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli wrote in a research note. He added that margins, which outperformed expectations, “were a bright spot.” 

The company is also reviewing options for its Dockers brand, “which could include a potential sale or other strategic transaction,” and has hired Bank of America as a financial adviser in the process. The brand’s sales declined 15% to $73.7 million in the latest quarter. 

The San Francisco-based company is looking to spark buzz by partnering with Beyoncé. The pop star gave the brand some unexpected publicity earlier this year with a song titled “Levii’s Jeans” on her latest album.

Hedge Funds are dumping energy stocks at the fastest pace since June 2022 according to Goldman Sachs,"https://twitter.com/Barchart/status/1840982914831438207?t=KGgpDh5eP2UpJBngLtMX0w&s=19

 funds have been offloading US energy stocks at the fastest rate seen in five years marking the sector as the most heavily sold on Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage trading desk last week, according to a report by Reuters.

The report cites a note sent to clients on Friday as highlighting that the rapid increase in short positions came as the S&P Energy Index (SPNY) dropped nearly 5% in the week leading up to 26 September. Although the sector rebounded with a 1% rally on Friday, driven by hopes of more Federal Reserve rate cuts following a soft inflation report, hedge funds had already ramped up their bearish bets.

Goldman Sachs noted that hedge funds targeted a variety of US energy companies, including oil and gas firms, consumable fuel providers, and equipment suppliers. The proportion of short bets outpaced long positions by a ratio of nearly six to one, signalling significant bearish sentiment in the sector.

The surge in short selling last week continued a broader trend of sustained divestment, with hedge funds having been selling off energy stocks for five consecutive weeks.

The selloff comes amid a gloomy outlook for oil prices. A recent Reuters poll of 41 analysts and economists projected that Brent crude would average $81.52 per barrel in 2024—its lowest forecast since February and down from August’s estimate of $82.86.",40,18,1727887610.0

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Edgescale AI Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today a strategic partnership to deliver Live Edge, a groundbreaking combination of Palantir Edge AI and Edgescale AI distributed infrastructure technology, designed to operationalize artificial intelligence (AI) in manufacturing, utilities, and other complex industrial environments.

“Live Edge is a game changer to tap new operational data sets and accelerate new use case segments”

Scaling AI to the Real World

AI is reshaping the world and transforming our relationship with technology, yet applying AI to operational technology in industries and critical infrastructure remains a challenge. So long as the complexity and operational burden of activating machines, equipment, vehicles, and sensors in physical systems remains high, we only achieve a fraction of AI’s true potential for automating our technology and improving our lives.

Edgescale AI was founded to overcome these challenges. Led by industry experts and thought leaders in AI, including renowned telecommunications executive Marc Rouanne, serial entrepreneur Brian Mengwasser, and San Francisco-based Intellectus Partners, Edgescale AI is revolutionizing how AI interacts with connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices in physical systems and unlocking the potential of physical AI with its ecosystem of partners.

To achieve this, Edgescale AI automates the creation of distributed, operations-grade cloud environments - Virtual Connected Edges (VCEs) - which facilitate the flow of data to and from devices and AI. Leading enterprises and software companies work with Edgescale AI to accelerate the deployment of AI and to enable more autonomous devices, make smarter decisions, and increase productivity.

""The next phase of AI is operating on real-world data,” said Brian Mengwasser, the Co-founder and CEO of Edgescale AI. ""We’ve reimagined and reinvented the cloud to encompass physical devices, where data comes from and actions have real-world impact. We eliminate the friction for our customers to deploy the latest AI capabilities anywhere. We’re proud to launch this breakthrough first with Palantir, the category leader in production-grade AI.”",8,3,1727885965.0
What’s going on with Novo Nordisk (NVO)?,"The stock did have a pretty nice run in the last year, but it’s slid in the past few months (~20% since it’s High in June) for no clear reason (I understand it should have dropped short term based on the below, but this seems a little more than I would have expected). Their capacity was stretched, so they acquired manufacturers and also are working to expand their own internal capacity. Compared to LLY it seems like this company is more focused and leaner, which to me seems like a plus. They lowered forecasts, but I didn’t see this as warranting the drop it ended up seeing.

People aren’t going to just stop needing their medication, also from what I understand right now they have one of the most competitive oral pills for weight loss in the pipeline right now and working to offer their medication in China which has one of the largest obese populations in the world. 

Lastly it’s PE/Forward PE aren’t too high versus the average of the industry. LLY on the other hand has a PE over 100 right now and a forward PE in the 30 range. I don’t particularly buy this, both LLY and NVO have research in the pipeline, but don’t see how LLY can lower their PE by that much in the next year or so. 

I only bring up LLY in all of this because it seems like it’s been hit less than NVO. Both drugs are pretty overpriced (can stem from a  lack of regulation of PBMs) so for all this senate hearing noise, I don’t see why it effects one more than the other besides the fact that LLY is a US company and NVO is not.

What’s everyone else’s take on this? Is there something I’m missing here?

Edit: in regard to capital structure, LLY also has a greater reliance on debt than NVO. Dont necessarily think this is a bad thing, but worth noting NVO isn’t growing/expanding through added debt. ",62,56,1727881291.0

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla’s financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It’s one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla’s, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company’s total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn’t issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla’s brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called “racist hate,” and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of “dedicated robotaxi.”

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

*Information services was the lone category posting a loss, down 10,000.*  
*Service providers accounted for 101,000 of the total, with goods producers adding the rest.*  
*From a size standpoint, all of the growth came from companies with more than 50 employees. Small firms saw a loss, with those employing fewer than 20 workers down by 13,000.*  
*The ADP count comes two days ahead of the Labor Department’s nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show growth of 150,000, following August’s disappointing showing of 142,000, of which 118,000 came from private sector hiring.*  
*While the ADP report serves as a precursor to the official count, the two can differ, sometimes by wide margins.*  
*Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as they contemplate the next move for monetary policy and interest rates. In a speech Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the labor market as “solid” while noting that it has “clearly cooled” over the past year.*  
*The Fed is expected to follow up its half percentage point rate cut in September with further reductions in November and December. The main question is whether the central bank will move in the same large increment or pivot back to a more conventional quarter-point move.*  
*Futures market pricing currently points to a quarter-point cut in November then a half-point move in December. Powell indicated that consecutive quarter-point moves are the more likely scenario now, though policymakers remain attuned to the data and will adjust accordingly.*",95,20,1727871436.0

"Why ExxonMobil, Conoco Phillips, and Lockheed Martin Rallied on a Down Day for the Markets","Shares of oil and gas majors ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Conoco Phillips (NYSE: COP), as well as defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), rallied on Tuesday, up 2.8%, 4.2%, and 3.5%, respectively, as of 1:17 p.m. ET, even as the broader indices were down between 1% and 2% at that time.

Fortunately for their shareholders, but unfortunately for other sectors and the world, these critical companies saw their stocks rally as oil prices spiked on news that Iran was launching an imminent attack on Israel.

On Tuesday, a senior White House official said Iran is preparing to launch an imminent ballistic missile attack on Israel. Then at midday, the Israel Defense Forces reported Iran had in fact launched missiles toward Israel. The attack comes after Israel has struck against Iran's proxy army Hezbollah operating in southern Lebanon. In addition, Israel is preparing a limited military operation in southern Lebanon to clear the area of Hezbollah militants.

Given that Iran and other Middle East neighbors are major oil and gas producers, the prospect of a wider regional conflict has the potential to disrupt oil supplies to the rest of the world. This is why both ExxonMobil and Conoco Phillips rallied along with oil prices, which were up nearly 4.5% to $71.25 as of this writing.

Higher oil prices would obviously benefit the top and bottom lines of Exxon and Conoco. Conoco is a pure explorer, but doesn't have significant production in the Middle East region. And though Exxon is more diversified with midstream and downstream assets, it still makes the bulk of its earnings through oil and gas exploration, and therefore benefits when prices rise. Furthermore, Exxon derives most of its exploration from outside the Middle East.

And obviously, whenever geopolitical tensions ramp up, that usually bodes well for U.S. defense contractors' stocks, with Lockheed Martin being the second-largest U.S. defense contractors by market cap.

Lockheed has actually had a tremendous year, with the stock surging over the summer on the back of better-than-expected earnings and more sales of its F-35 fighter jets to more allied countries.

In addition to general geopolitical news, Exxon and Lockheed also received two positive company-specific bits of news today. Exxon received approval from the Nigerian government to sell its Nigeria offshore assets to Seplat for $1.28 billion. Of note, Nigeria has been somewhat of a difficult geography for oil and gas operators recently, due to theft and corruption. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin received a near $3.9 billion naval contract for its Trident missile systems today, in addition to some smaller aeronautics contracts.

Neither news item is tremendously impactful to either company, given the overall size of these industry giants; however, these items were still likely incremental positives.

While oil and gas stocks are out of fashion for many investors, given the focus on climate change and reducing emissions, they do offer a hedge against geopolitical events, such as the one we are seeing today. Remember, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, traditional energy stocks went on to be some of the best performers that year.

So while oil and gas and defense stocks may not be as exciting as high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) plays these days, they do offer benefits in a healthily diversified portfolio. Moreover, most traditional energy and defense stocks also pay decent dividends.

So, today should be a reminder to investors of the role these types of stocks can play, offering hedges against geopolitical disasters, all while paying you growing dividends in the meantime.

Is CELH a BUY?!,"Celcius has sold off quite a bit after their deal with Pepsi to take over distribution for them. Main issue was that pepsi took too much inventory from them and that invetory caused an oversupply for pepsi to burn through before getting more product from Celcius. This is my limited understanding of the issue. This company also looks great financially and their product is footprint is growing in stores. The have low debt, high equity to liability ratio, retained earning also increasing last two years.  I walked into wegmans today and it was piled up on the floor right in front of all the registers. Anyway, the only thing that gives me pause is their preferred stock issuance and how it relates to their cash see link below. Do you think their cash looks nice becasue of the stock issuance? I'm told that preferred stock is bad because it's a sneaky way to finance with debt instead of through the business. What are your thoughts on CELH?

"Nike postpones investor day, posts mixed quarterly results as it gears up for CEO change","Nike on Tuesday said it was postponining its investor day as it delivered mixed fiscal first quarter results.

Here’s how the world’s largest sneaker retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 70 cents vs 52 cents

Revenue: $11.59 billion vs $11.65 billion

Over the last year, Nike has been accused of falling behind on innovation and ceding share to competitors as it focused on selling directly to consumers through its own websites and stores rather than through wholesalers such as Foot Locker and DSW. 

The company announced in September that CEO John Donahoe would be stepping down and would be replaced by company veteran Elliott Hill, who is scheduled to take the helm Oct. 14.

Under Donahoe’s leadership, the company grew annual sales by more than 31%, but it got there by churning out legacy franchises such as Air Force 1s, Dunks and Air Jordan 1s — not the groundbreaking styles that turned the company into a global powerhouse. 

Over the last few quarters, Donahoe has spoken about the need to improve innovation and mend Nike’s relationships with wholesalers, but the company’s board decided that Hill, who spent 32 years with Nike before retiring in 2020, would be the right person to lead its next chapter. 

Donahoe is expected to be present during the company’s conference call with investors Tuesday afternoon, but observers will be keen to see if there are any clues into where the company is planning to go under Hill’s leadership. 

The incoming CEO will need to power up Nike’s innovation pipeline, reset its relationships with wholesalers and improve morale after a series of layoffs and a breakdown in culture. 

Overall, the sneaker market has been relatively stagnant in the U.S. Consumer spending on discretionary goods such as new clothes and shoes has been sluggish, which has made Nike’s situation that much more difficult. 

Footwear sales in the U.S. are projected to grow by just 2% in 2024 compared with 2023 after barely budging between 2022 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. Athletic footwear is expected to grow by about 5.6%, the firm said. 

Nike’s performance has also been weighed down by the uneven economy in China, Nike’s third-largest market by revenue, which will be another key item to watch for in the earnings report. Nike’s performance in China is often an indicator of the region’s financial health, and in late June, it warned of a “softer outlook” in the region. However, China’s central bank recently unveiled its largest stimulus measures since the Covid pandemic, which is expected to give the region’s economy a much-needed boost. 

Nike’s fiscal first quarter would have concluded prior to those stimulus measures, but executives may share color on how sales are performing during the current period. 

Shares of Nike closed at $88.40 on Monday, down about 19% so far in 2024, significantly underperforming the S&P 500′s gains of about 21%.

Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",38,27,1727810140.0
PepsiCo to buy tortilla chip maker Siete Foods for $1.2 billion,"PepsiCo
 said Tuesday that it’s buying Mexican American food company Siete Foods for $1.2 billion, marking the company’s first food acquisition in roughly five years.

Like many food companies, Pepsi has been trying to shift its portfolio to include healthier options in recent years, usually through acquisitions. Recent additions include Bare Snacks, Health Warrior and PopCorners.


Soon that will also include Siete. Founder Veronica Garza started the company in 2014, when she began selling grain-free tortillas. Since then, its portfolio has grown to include tortilla chips, taco shells, salsas and seasonings, often designed to accommodate different dietary restrictions. Retailers like Target,
Kroger,
 Whole Foods and CVS
 carry the company’s products.

“We look forward to expanding our multicultural portfolio with these incredible products and even more consumers discovering and enjoying Siete,” Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, assuming it receives regulatory approval.

Deal-making has picked up this year for packaged food companies, who are turning to acquisitions to drive sales growth as shoppers buy less of their products. In August, M&M’s owner Mars announced it would purchase Pringles parent Kellanova
 in a deal valued at nearly $36 billion. This March, Campbell Soup
 completed its $2.7 billion acquisition of Rao’s pasta sauce maker Sovos Brand.

The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Oct 01, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

"can stock picking be safer than the S&P, during its higher P/E periods?","

The historical (1971 - 2017) average P/E ratio of the S&P is 19.4.

Regarding the last 5 years, its average is 20.47
and the current number is 29.137.

Without debating its current valuation, would you argue picking specific stocks, for short to mid term holding, as a somewhat ""safer"" play when this ratio is higher than average? 

And if so, what makes certain picks risk-compensating to you?

China's '08 crisis' - Is this the reversal?,"My name is MrJSmyth.

For the last 2 years I have slowly been buying up Chinese equities. Month after month, they fell time and time again. 

As many of you may know, Chinese stocks took a sudden nose dive during Covid. The CCP announced major lock downs, they fined their big tech and took cash from their reserves. They cracked down on many of their private companies including the likes of Alibaba and Tencent just to name a few. Then you had the political divide with things such as a potential war between Taiwan, the spy balloon controversy with the US and also a possible chance of delisting the ADR's off the US stock exchanges just to name a few.

Let's just say it hasn't been a pretty few years. HOWEVER.

One thing I noticed was that their balance sheets never took a nose dive in the way their stock price did. Their economy still grew at 4% near it's lows and even though the housing market was crashing due to the big property developers not being able to finish the projects, China was still growing. Slower, but still growing.

With this information I looked through some of China's biggest names and every 3 months checked in on their earnings and the rest of their balance sheet material. 

It didn't take long to notice that the stocks were not falling due to declining sales but more so due to political interference.

100 years ago no one was buying stocks from Germany, they were public enemy number 1. Now if I could tell you that you could buy some of Germanys biggest companies for pennies on the dollar back then you would do it with 20/20 hindsight. Well, I believed the same thing for China.

So, I begun buying. Over the last 2 years I have bought more that £50,000 worth of stock in Chinese equities, lowering my average each and every quater.

As of the past few months my chinese portfolio has pulled very slightly into the green and we are still so far off the all time highs from the likes of Alibaba and Tencent.

Now I am not saying we will ever reach those highs again or that I won't go into the red again however I do believe that over the last 2 years I have bought at 08 levels and now it appears the Chinese market could be ready to rip. 

Again, this is all opinion and speculation.

My question to you lovely folk of reddit is this. What is your thoughts on the Chinese market and also, if you were around during the 08 period, how did you benefit/get slaughtered by the great crash of 08.

Thanks for taking time to read this piece. 

Kind Regards

&#x200B;

*Key Points*

* *Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*
* *“We are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics.*
* *Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*

&#x200B;

*Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Monday that the recent half percentage point interest rate cut shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that future moves will be as aggressive.*  
  
*Instead, the central bank chief asserted during a speech in Nashville, he and his colleagues will seek to balance bringing down inflation with supporting the labor market and let the data guide future moves.*  
  
*“Looking forward, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, policy will move over time toward a more neutral stance. But we are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.”*  
  
*The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction in the Fed’s key overnight borrowing rate.*  
  
*Though markets had been largely expecting the move, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008.*  
  
*Addressing the decision, Powell said it reflected policymakers’ belief that it was time for a “recalibration” of policy that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as “solid” though it has “clearly cooled over the last year.”*  
  
*“That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective,” Powell said.*  
  
*“We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation,” added Powell, who gave no outward indication of where he sees the next move going.*  
  
*Powell’s assertion that the Fed has not predetermined policy is in keeping with past statements.*  
  
*Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut.*  
  
*For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*  
  
*Inflation during August was around 2.2% annually, according to the Fed’s preferred consumer price expenditures prices index released Friday. While that is close to the central bank’s 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items.*  
  
*Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals.*  
  
*“Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly,” he said. “The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*  
  
*Following the speech, Powell was scheduled to sit for a question-and-answer session with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.*",401,89,1727719261.0
Carnival Stock Slips After Record-Setting Quarter Offset by Weak Outlook,"[Investopedia article](https://www.investopedia.com/carnival-record-setting-quarter-offset-by-weak-outlook-update-8720379); CCL was down much lower earlier, but is now at -2.75%.

The outlook portion that is bringing down CCL stock:

> Carnival anticipates net yields growing by approximately 5.0% in constant currency in the fourth quarter and by about 10.4% for the full year. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for 5.76% and 10.52%, respectively. Net yield measures revenue per available passenger cruise day, after deducting expenses like airfare, commissions, and other direct costs.

Some other info on the earnings [from street insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Earnings/Carnival+Corp.+%28CCL%29+Tops+Q3+EPS+by+10c/23778490.html):

Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) reported Q3 EPS of $1.27, $0.10 better than the analyst estimate of $1.17. Revenue for the quarter came in at $7.89 billion versus the consensus estimate of $7.82 billion.

2024 Outlook

For the full year 2024, the company expects:

* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 10.4 percent compared to 2023, better than June guidance, based on continued strength in demand.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 3.5 percent compared to 2023, approximately 1 percentage point better than June guidance driven by cost saving opportunities, accelerated easing of inflationary pressures and benefits from one-time items.
* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $6.0 billion, up over 40 percent compared to 2023 and better than June guidance by nearly $200 million.
* Adjusted return on invested capital (""ROIC"") of approximately 10.5 percent, an improvement of approximately 5.0 percentage points compared to 2023 and half a point better than June guidance.
* For the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects:
* Net yields (in constant currency) up approximately 5.0 percent compared to particularly strong 2023 levels.
* Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD (in constant currency) up approximately 8.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due primarily to higher dry-dock days and higher investment in advertising.
* Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.14 billion, up 20 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

Which companies / sectors will AI replace/destroy?,"The title is self-explanatory.

We're all witnessing the impact of AI, and there's no doubt it can be super beneficial to many. However, at the same time, it is clear that some jobs can be easily replaced (or, more accurately, destroyed, from humans' point of view).

I do not engage in short selling, so the goal of this post isn't to find companies (or sectors) to short-sell. Rather, the goal is to spark a discussion on this topic.

Eyeing Simply Good Foods (SMPL) for a LT Investment,"I'm considering an investment in Simply Good Foods (SMPL) as part of a 20-year strategy in the consumer goods space. Why? Because I believe consumer goods companies that align with health trends can grow even in downturns. I’m aiming for a long-term hold, looking for strong growth, stable value, and low debt.

**Why Simply Good Foods?** The company owns three key brands: Atkins, Quest, and OWYN. While Atkins and OWYN have their challenges, Quest is a leader in the protein bar market. If a store sells protein bars, they probably stock Quest. It's a solid brand with mass distribution and great market share among fitness and health-conscious consumers.

**Recent Financial Performance**: The company has been growing steadily. Fiscal 2023 saw $955.6 million in net sales, driven mainly by Quest, with 14.2% growth in sales. Plus, they operate an asset-light model, which means they outsource manufacturing – keeping costs low and free cash flow high. Cash reserves increased to $208.7 million, and debt was reduced to $237.7 million – signs of solid financial health.

**Growth Catalysts**:

* Acquisition of OWYN: Simply Good Foods bought OWYN, a plant-based protein brand, for $280 million. This taps into the rising trend of plant-based diets and brings a whole new consumer base.
* E-commerce Opportunities: They’re expanding their e-commerce channels – currently, 21% of Quest and 14% of Atkins sales are online – so there's definitely room for growth here.

**Competition & Risks**: Simply Good Foods does face competition in both bars and drinks. But Quest’s distribution advantage gives it a strong moat, and with Atkins and OWYN being rebranded, there’s potential for growth. Still, they’ll need to walk a fine line to keep market share against competitors like FitCrunch, Pure Protein, and bigger players like Fairlife (Coke).

**Final Thoughts**: SMPL feels like an interesting long-term play, aligning with health and nutrition trends while being reasonably valued and not over-leveraged. But it’s not without challenges – especially in marketing, e-commerce, and competition in the drink and bar markets.

If you’re invested or have thoughts on Simply Good Foods, I'd love to hear! And if you've tried any of their products – Atkins, Quest, or OWYN – let me know what you think. Consumer feedback is key in understanding how strong a brand really is.",19,22,1727636273.0

Simulating an international ETF for my portfolio based on market cap. Would this be a nightmare?,"Hello, I am a Canadian investor who has most of my money in S&P 500 Etfs, Nasdaq ETFs, other various ETFs, Berkshire Hathaways, and a small amount of stocks. Not very diversified outside of America. I buy these on the TSX mostly in Canadian funds, but I also have some in American dollars bought form the NYSE.

I have a desire to diversify outside of America but have always been disappointed in the gains of international ETFs compared to US based ones. I have also been reading recently about how large market cap companies generally grow better than small ones. It does kind of make sense in a world of increasing hyper capitalism, where big money can grow better, innovate better, and buy up competition. Taking these factors in to account, I am going to explore simulating an ETF of large cap international stocks.

My method is going to be to take a set of the biggest market cap international companies and buy some. Their size of the pie will be based on percentage of market cap.

https://www.tradingview.com/markets/world-stocks/worlds-non-us-companies/

To do a simple example, if I only wanted to do the 5 top companies in the world outside of US, it would be Saudi Aramco at 1.777 trillion market cap, Taiwan Semiconductor at 820 billion, Novo Nordisk at 528, Tencent at 521, and Louis Vuitton at 392. Their total market cap is 4.038 trillion. As far as percentages of that total, Saudi Aramco is 44.0%, Taiwan Semiconductor is 20.3%, Novo Nordisk is 13.1%, Tencent is 12.9%, and Louie Vuitton is 9.7%.

Say you have 10k to invest, you would buy $4400 of Saudi Aramco, $2030 of Taiwan Semiconductors, $1310 of Novo Nordisk, $1290 of Tencent $1290, and $970 of Louie Vuitton. Let's say we re-balance these every quarter, so as some companies strengthen, we buy more, and as they weaken we sell, and if a company drops off the top 5, we ditch it and get the new arrival. And if the list of companies is 20 or more deep, it should be some nice diversification of countries and industries, but with one thing in common, they are all ultra successful companies. 

Do people have opinions on this strategy? It's basically running a personal one-man-show international ETF (I tried looking for a product that would do this for me but none satisfied my desire of just the top of the top international companies). How difficult would this be to do and what would be potential tax ramifications? I believe as a Canadian I would use Interactive brokers for the multiple currencies, and buying fractional shares which I believe I can do on there, but I've never used it. Also can I access all stock markets these companies would be available on via Interactive brokers? I could potential do this in my Tax Free Savings Account to not have to deal with taxes, but if I did it in my taxable account what would the ramifications be? Also any advice on the ramifications or how to deal with the dividends? 

Any thoughts or tips on this strategy would be greatly appreciated, also is there a way to backtest this strategy, perhaps I could simplify to re-balance once a year. Thanks in advance for any advice.

And if some big investment company wants to take this idea and make a top 20 ex-US ETF or a top 50 ex-US ETF via market cap, go right ahead and I'll be the first to buy. And maybe give me a little kickback if it's popular ;)

EDIT: Looks like one issure is many of these companies are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which I can't buy as a Canadian. Therefore some of these large companies will be left off unless there is a workaround",7,6,1727600082.0
Title: Potential Investment in Breathe BioMedical Inc. ($BRTH) - Thoughts on Their Upcoming IPO?,"Hello everyone,

I’m considering investing in Breathe BioMedical Inc. ($BRTH) as they’re planning to go public soon. I found some information in the IPO Investing Center in the SoFi app, and I’m currently trying to evaluate if this would be a worthwhile investment. From what I’ve gathered, Breathe BioMedical is focused on developing diagnostic tools for early disease detection, which sounds promising given the growing healthcare and biotechnology trends. However, I’d really appreciate your input on this opportunity.

Some specific things I’m considering:

	1.	Company Overview & Market Position: Does anyone have deeper insight into Breathe BioMedical’s competitive edge? How does their technology stack up against other diagnostic companies, especially in early detection?
	2.	Product & Market Demand: How viable is their product? From what I understand, they’re in the field of non-invasive diagnostics—how strong is the demand for such technology in the current and projected future market? Are they addressing a significant unmet need?
	3.	Financial Health & IPO Valuation: I haven’t been able to find a lot of financial details, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on their valuation and whether their financials suggest they have the runway needed for sustainable growth. Have any of you seen their financial metrics, and do they seem justifiable for an IPO?
	4.	Regulatory & Clinical Considerations: Given the nature of their business, they’ll need regulatory approvals for their technology. Does anyone know the current status of these approvals or any clinical trials? How risky is this aspect of the investment?
	5.	Management Team & Experience: I’m also curious about the management team’s track record. Do they have the experience necessary to navigate the complexities of the biotech and diagnostic space? Have they led successful ventures in the past?
	6.	Broader Market Conditions: Considering the recent trends in biotech and healthcare IPOs, do you think this sector is currently favorable for a new player like Breathe BioMedical? How do current market conditions influence your perspective on investing in a company like this?

Overall, I see a lot of potential in early disease detection technologies, especially non-invasive ones, but I also recognize the challenges of investing in a company at such an early stage. Would love to hear your opinions, insights, or any research you may have done on $BRTH. Do you think this could be a good long-term investment, or are there major red flags I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

I don’t have any relevant background or expertise, but I’ve increasingly felt compelled to learn about it so I'm at least not totally ignorant. At this point, I’ve mostly been watching YouTube interviews of Altman/Zuckerberg/Gates types, along with lectures that Stanford makes available.

In the midst of this, I watched two videos in which separate AI researchers mentioned a [2019 blog post titled “The Bitter Lesson.”](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html) Apparently, this blog post was written by a computer scientist and is really influential in the field. One of the main takeaways, as I understand it, is that all that really matters for improving AI is providing more computing power.

Given how much the tech community seems to believe this, I decided to make a few plays in the space, buying literally just a few shares of NVDA, AMD, and GOOGL earlier this week. NVDA and GOOGL are obviously some of the biggest names in the space, albeit in different aspects. I took a chance on AMD, even though people seem to say their tech isn't as good, just because I still feel like it could rise with the rest of the field as long as people keep thinking AI is the future.

To be candid, I’m cynical about about how AI will be used and, more broadly, I don’t really think this is a great time to just now be getting into the market- from my perspective, it still seems like a lot of people are burnt out from work/life, and the companies that are making more money seem to be doing so largely by raising prices. I’m not sure how sustainable it all is without some sort of correction. Still, I wanted to get a little skin in the game so that I’m motivated to keep learning.

If anyone finds any of this worth talking about, I have two ongoing questions at this point:

1)    What really excites people in the field about generative AI/large language models from a technological/computer science perspective? For example, when blockchain was blowing up, I heard it said that Blockchain was exciting because it made it possible to transfer a digital file such that the original sender no longer possessed the file after sending. Regardless of my personal opinions on the technology, that explanation at least made sense to me, and I could imagine possible applications and why people might be excited. What is it about AI that likewise has tech experts so excited really? What specifically does it allow them to do that they could never do before, and why is that valuable?

2)    Outside of the people running tech companies, who is really positioned to benefit from AI? In nearly every video I see of Sam Altman talking, he says something like, “I believe AI will have a positive net benefit on society overall.” I wonder, though, how he would measure this. It seems to me like AI will help any company or user that can leverage it to make money, but could end up harming a lot of employees and end consumers. I feel like it could just accelerate trends of companies extracting more and more money from the rest of the population. I'm really not trying to make this political or turn it into a debate on capitalism. That’s just my honest gut feeling about it from an economic perspective at this point. I see it providing a lot of benefit to a relatively small segment of the population.

Would be interested to hear what other people think and if/how you are investing in the space. I'd even like to know if people here actually use AI in their personal lives. And if anyone has resources that they feel have helped deepen their knowledge about AI, I’d really appreciate you sharing. I feel like I’ve kind of hit a wall trying to get beyond surface-level discussions about the field.

"A definitive, verifiable GameStop update","There was a comment on this sub after the most recent GameStop earnings asking:

*“With all the attention on GME, I would really appreciate hearing a factual argument about how this is a positive for shareholders and a positive for the future of the company. There seems to be a stark divide between what some people want to happen and what appears to be happening.”*

Here are some Q&A-style answers to that comment and others I’ve seen.

**Why don’t GameStop investors care that revenue is decreasing?**

This is probably the biggest misconception about the company’s outlook – the role of the legacy business.

The pre-2021 main bull case for GameStop stock was not that the company would *definitely* turn itself around, but rather that Wall Street was too eager in pegging it for bankruptcy, resulting in its low stock price. The company *was* struggling, but investors like Keith Gill believed that bankruptcy was further on the horizon, that the secular headwinds were overstated for the near-term, that the company had more time than believed to address those concerns.

Fast-forward to 2024. Bankruptcy has been all but removed from the conversation, though more so due to stock offerings as opposed to the resilience of console gaming. Even so, this still upholds the original bull thesis because now it seems they have all the time in the world to right the ship, right?

Not necessarily. The legacy business is still a liability. I say ""legacy"" because many GME investors (including Gill, per his latest stream) aren't sure physical gaming is the future for this company, but it is the current reality. The company is fine, but the business model is flawed and staring at those same secular headwinds. Therefore, the company’s revenue decrease has been attributed more to efforts to right-size those operations in order to return to profitability, thus minimizing the current business model as a liability. It comes at the expense of revenue, but that’s not as big of a concern as it would have been without the cash hoard income they’ve acquired.

**What** ***are*** **investors looking for in the earnings reports?**

More hints at what the cash reserve will be used for. No real plan laid out at this moment.

**Why doesn’t that bother you?**

From a neutral perspective, it seems reasonable to assume one of two possibilities:

* There isn’t a definitive plan for the cash at this moment.
* If there is a plan, it would likely deploy in one aggressive swoop (based on how Cohen tends to invest), so signaling beforehand may seem imprudent to the board.

PERSONALLY (re: now we’re entering into my speculative bull case), I think the timing of the cash deployment will coincide with one thing – the steadying of revenue.

It seems clear that the board is not interested in expanding into new revenue streams unless they're really sure there's no risk to profit margin, however meager. In my opinion, the moment they see that revenues AND profit are holding steady – in other words, that the legacy business is swimming on its own in its little kiddy pool – we will see cash being deployed.

That’s probably my biggest bull case for the stock in the near-term. I don’t buy that the long-term plan is T-bills for that cash hoard. Whether or not you believe Cohen is a savvy investor, one pattern is very clear – when he bets on something, it’s usually a swing for the fences. I think the market will react intensely to the news that GameStop has started deploying its cash reserves, regardless of what the cash ends up being used for.

 

I caution everyone on this sub and others to avoid dismissing the case for GameStop simply because of its intense online following. I really wish it could be talked about in more neutral terms. The reality of most discussion around it being so hyperbolic (whether negative or positive hyperbole) has made it really hard to seek out good sounding boards for discussion.",2,178,1727457188.0
Why Healthcare stocks not popular around?,"I am new to stock market subs. What caught my attention is healthcare stocks are rarely discussed. I am surprised because unlike other industries:

* Healthcare companies announce product sales and regional sales numbers
* Healthcare companies clearly state if there is competition or not
* Easier to forecast because both Patent expiry date and pipeline are public information

What I like about healthcare market at large:

* Healthcare is one of three defensive industries according to Morningstar. Others are Utilities and Consumer Defensive. Utilities almost always underperform the market. For Consumer Defensive, there are huge barriers to entry. Bluechips in Beverages or Tobacco are hard to challenge. In bear market I am going to buy Utilities and Consumer Defensive; otherwise I chase Healthcare for defensive stocks and stability in my portfolio.
* The reason I go for healthcare stocks is that they possess protected downside with upside potential. It is hard to quantify the ""upside."" I try to ask healthcare professional friends of mine about the drugs.
* Another reason that I go for HC is its historical performance compared to other costs. I am sure most of you are familiar with Moore's law. Please also check Eroom's Law (that is opposite of Moore's) which applies to healthcare industry. There are countless articles about the increase in healthcare spending despite technological advancement over years. Bad news for citizens, good for investors.

East Coast port strike looms for first time since 1977.,">Thousands of dockworkers at every major East and Gulf coast port are girding to strike starting early next week, threatening to close trade gateways that handle about half of all goods shipped in containers in and out of the U.S.

>Negotiations between the union representing dockworkers and a shipping industry group representing terminal operators and ocean carriers have been stalled for months, with both sides this week issuing conflicting statements about their willingness to bargain.

>The union representing 45,000 dockworkers, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), is threatening to strike at ports from Massachusetts to Texas if a new labor deal with the USMX isn't reached before the current contract expires at midnight on September 30. A walkout would be the first East Coast dock strike since 1977. 

>The ports that could close in a strike handle more than 68% of all containerized exports in the U.S. and roughly 56% of containerized imports, according to industry data. So even a short strike would cause significant disruptions in regional trade flows. One analysis estimated that could cost the U.S. economy as much $5 billion a day.

Deep dive into Manchester United ($MANU) - Rich Men's Ego Boost,"**1.0 Introduction**

Back in 2012, Manchester United became a public company, at $14/share. 

Over a decade later with many ups and downs, the share price is **up disappointing 18%**. For comparison, the S&P500 is up **over 300%** during the same period, and the FTSE100 is up a bit **over 40%**.

The club’s financials continue to deteriorate, and I’m sure anyone who supports a sports club has plenty of ideas about what can be done differently.

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why the club is deteriorating (financially) and how I concluded that **sports clubs are billionaires’ toys that serve to boost their egos.**

  
**2.0 How does Manchester United (or any other sports club) make money?**

Sports clubs generally have 3 key revenue sources and here’s what the development of each one looked like for Manchester United over the last decade:

**Commercial**: £303m (vs. £189, a decade ago) - Growth of 4.8% per year

**Broadcasting**: £222m (vs. £136m a decade ago) - Growth of 5% per year

**Matchday**: £137m (vs. £108m a decade ago) - Growth of 2.4% per year



Let’s have a look at each one separately, and in each segment, try to answer the following question: ***How much is this revenue source depending on the fans?***

**2.1 Commercial revenue** consists of:

1. **Sponsorship deals** with various global and regional partners - Such as TeamViewer, the main sponsor on their shirts, but also the ones shown on the advertisement boards around the field.
2. **Merchandising, product licensing, and retail** - Club-branded merchandise, including shirts, training kits, and other apparel. It also covers licensing agreements that allow third parties to produce and sell Manchester United-branded products.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Absolutely! The link to the merchandising and product licensing/retail segment is quite clear, but the sponsorship deals are also valued based on the exposure given to the companies. The more fans a club has, the more a company is willing to pay for its promotion.



**2.2 Broadcasting revenue** has a comparable growth, averaging **5% per year**. Apart from the revenue share of the matches (Premier League, Champions League, and other competitions), this includes MANU TV, a monthly subscription that generates over £6m per year.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** Not always, as a significant portion of it is split equally, regardless of the club and the number of fans. However, it is dependent on the success of the club and its participation in major competitions.



**2.3** **Matchday revenue** doesn’t need any introduction, although it had surprisingly low growth of \~2% per year, which is lower than the inflation rate.

***Is this depending a lot on the fans?*** - Absolutely!



*Conclusion: All of the 3 revenue sources have very low growth, and are dependent on the two key points:*

* *The competitions the club participates in, and its success in them, and*
* *The number of fans (attending the matches, paying for MUTV, buying apparel, etc.)*

**It is safe to say that over 70% of all the revenue is derived directly from the fans.**

  
**3.0 Key expenses**

Now, let’s have a look at the key expenses and their development over time:

**Employee benefit expenses**: £365m (vs. £215, a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

**Amortization**: £190m (vs. £55m a decade ago) - Growth of 11.2% per year

**Other operating expenses**: £149m (vs. £88m a decade ago) - Growth of 5.4% per year

  
What you will notice is that **all of them have been growing at a faster pace than the revenue.** The key drivers behind this are the **larger transfer fees** and **higher salaries**. It is worth noting that the recent involvement of the Saudi clubs put even more pressure. Here's some more information about each category, for those who are interested:

**Employee benefit expenses -** The compensation of the players, managers, staff, administration, etc.

**Amortization -** Anytime a player is bought from another club, the costs associated with the acquisition of the player are capitalized, and then amortized over the duration of the contract period. For example, if a player had a £30m transfer fee, and the contract length is 3 years, there will be a £10m amortization expense per year recognized in the income statement.

**Other operating expenses -** All the other expenses, ranging from security stewarding and cleaning at Old Trafford to property costs, maintenance, HR, professional fees, etc.

  
**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**

So, if we add all of this together, the outcome is low revenue growth, with significant declining profitability. The operating margin is down from **positive 15%** to **negative 10%.** This is, after all, a very competitive environment, where no single team has been at the very top for decades in all competitions. It requires significant investments (especially in players and top management), and even then, success is not guaranteed and is temporary.

*So, you might ask:* **What is the value of a company that is not profitable, operates in a competitive field, and even success is temporary? The answer will likely be $0.**



**5.0 There is no value?**

So, is there no value? Is one of the biggest clubs in the world worthless?

I’d argue that Manchester United, like other sports clubs, aren’t valued, as there’s no significant positive free cash flow. Instead, they are being **priced**. They are in the same group as Pokemon cards, antiques, and art paintings. The beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Except, the beholders are billionaires, and they’re likely going through a checklist.

Did I buy 5 more houses? Great, check.

How about a yacht and a private jet? Yep, got it.

Damn, there’s still a lot of money left, what should I do? Oh, wait, what about a sports club?

**The owners of a sports club (in this case, the Glazer family will make money only when they sell the club to someone who is willing to pay more than they initially paid.**

  
**6.0 The emotional side**

There’s another angle that we need to explore, which is the emotional side. Some fans proudly own shares of the club, where the goal is not so much to make more money but to be a proud minority owner of the club. As such, there is nothing wrong with that.

However, there have been many examples when the stock price went up/down for ridiculous reasons. For example, there was a share price increase in 2013, due to the announcement that the club signed Fellaini. On the other side, the share price dropped \~9% on the speculation that the club might sign Ezequiel Garay. I’ll leave it up to you to decide how impactful these events are on the club’s value.

Fans will always criticize the owners/managers for the poor performance, and to a large extent, rightfully so. However, when it comes to the financial side and the share price, Manchester United is not an exception.

Take a look at the share price of Juventus, and try to guess what the spike in 2018 relates to.

If you guessed ***Cristiano Ronaldo***, well done! Don’t get me wrong. Events like this have some (minor) impact on the success of the club during a short period of time. In the case of Ronaldo, it might even bring better sponsorship deals, higher ticket prices, and more apparel sales. However, it also comes with an additional cost (his salary!). **In the long run, none of these individual events have a significant impact on the value of a football club.**

Two other football clubs that are public are Borussia Dortmund and Sporting. You can have a look at their share prices too.

**7.0 The transfer period**

Although fans are generally emotional and excited about the club they support, the transfer period is just different. There is a lot of speculation to follow, building up the expectations for the year to come.

Well, here’s how the share price changed during the transfer period (From June 10th to September 1st), in each year since the company was public.



|Year|Manchester United|S&P500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2013|-1%|-1%|
|2014|-3%|3%|
|2015|7%|-6%|
|2016|-1%|4%|
|2017|-1%|2%|
|2018|22%|4%|
|2019|-4%|1%|
|2020|-10%|12%|
|2021|11%|7%|
|2022|11%|1%|
|2023|22%|5%|
|2024|3%|3%|
|**Total compounded return**|**64%**|**40%**|

As you can see, investing in Manchester United during the transfer period was a better decision than investing in the S&P500 during the same period. In fact, this return has been crushing the return of the stock since its IPO (which, as mentioned at the very beginning, is around a disappointing \~20%).

  
So, is this a terrible company to invest in? **Fundamentally, yes.**

Anyone who invests in Manchester United, bets that there will be a **transfer of ownership**, which will push the share price up. There were rumors for that back in February of 2023 when the share price went up almost double. Should those rumors come back, I do expect a movement of at least 60% from today’s share price.

'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The Chinese stock market is notching its strongest weekly gain since 2014.,"The CSI300 is up by 12.4% this week so far, which is its strongest weekly gain since December 2014 (+13.4%). By the end of the day, it could be strongest weekly gain since 2008. I know we hate investing in China in this sub, but there might be a point for adding a bit of China back into your portfolio today. There are two main investment theses:

1. The Chinese consumer is not financially weak, they are simply sentiment driven.
2. Chinese government support for the market is sending the signal for retail investors to invest.

**Point 1:** Context for today's environment. Chinese stock market pessimism reached peak in February 2024 as it appeared the government was not keen to provide policy support. This was a mistake in messaging by the CCP. Chinese investing culture is extremely different from the US. While US markets are more sophisticated and fundamental driven - Chinese investors are HIGHLY sentimental. Western media blames the collapse of real estate for the past 2-years of market underperformance, this is true, but not because its hurting Chinese people's financial health. It's the severing of trust in the government (that they would bail out the real estate firms and save the people's money and investment properties) that is the problem. The Chinese gross savings ratio sits at \~44%  - unlike US consumers and investors (US personal savings rate is 3%) who CAN'T spend if the market collpases, the Chinese are simply choosing not to consume or invest. 

So what does all this mean? It means the CCP needs to send the strongest possible message to the Chinese people that it will support the market and help the property industry. It doesn't actually have to do anything like a massive bailout, but it needs to be performative and convincing - like the Fed is in the US. Once sentiment swings positive, all that unallocated capital floods right back into the market - especially if it becomes a 'government-approved' medium. 

**Point 2:** And that's exactly what the CCP has done in the past week. It TELEVISED a PBOC announcement on a range of (tbh low-impact) fiscal policies. Then XJP called for an ""emergency"" politburo meeting to implement ""forceful"" rate cuts and support for real estate. They even allowed state-owned-entities (basically government fund managers) to borrow from the PBOC just to buy and prop up broad market indices. This is hugely sentiment swinging. The CCP is essentially saying to its people that ""you can invest safely, we are going to prioritise the market"", and retail is responding. 

The fact that the Chinese market might be having its strongest weekly gain since 2014 is pretty convenient because this coincides with the 2014 bubble when the Chinese government incentivised its citizens to invest in the market - a similar environment to today. What happened then:

1. The CSI almost DOUBLED between late 2014 to mid-2015. 
2. It caused one of the biggest bubbles and crashes in Chinese market history.

IMO if the market is headed for a V-shape recovery, China does not appear to be a long-term play. But there is a lot to be gained from the compressed spring that is Chinese equities rn. China Tech is arguably their strongest suite of stocks (fundamentally) and they have been going absolutely gangbusters over this week. I see strong upside over a 1-year time horizon, with downside risk being political tensions w/ US and CCP failure to follow through with policy support. I would reduce portfolio exposure approaching 2021 stock market peaks in the case of market exuberance. The ideal scenario is a slow-down or even correction to allow for more sustainable recovery. In which case, corrections represent compelling entry-points.

"Rivian Stock , Buy ??? ","Hey everyone,

I’m considering whether or not to purchase Rivian (RIVN) stock, but I’m on the fence and would love to hear your thoughts. With Rivian’s stock dropping significantly since its IPO, I’m wondering if now might be a good time to buy in or if it’s too risky given their current challenges.

On one hand, Rivian has had some positive developments, like their partnership with Amazon to deliver electric vans and the growing interest in their R1T and R1S models. They’ve also recently secured a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen, which might help with cash flow and expansion efforts. Plus, some analysts are still giving the stock a “buy” rating, predicting a potential rebound to around $17-30 over the next year, which would be a solid return from its current price.

However, there are also a lot of red flags. The company has been burning through cash at a rapid rate, losing $1.45 billion in just one quarter this year. On top of that, they missed delivery targets last year, and competition in the EV space is fierce. Some forecasts suggest that Rivian’s stock could drop even further, to around $13 or lower by next year, or even as low as $4 by 2030 if things don’t improve.

For those who have already invested in Rivian, do you think the stock has the potential to bounce back? Or is it likely to continue struggling with production delays and competition? I’m especially interested in hearing from those who have followed the company closely—do you see any key indicators that might suggest a rebound, or is this a risky bet that could lead to bigger losses?

Would love to get your input before making a decision! Thanks!",35,88,1727399852.0

Costco Wholesale misses quarterly revenue estimates,"Costco Wholesale missed market expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday on cautious spending by budget-conscious customers at its membership-only stores, as well as an impact from lower gasoline prices.

Shares of the company were down marginally in volatile extended trading. They have gained about 37% so far this year.

While ultra-low prices on groceries and other kitchen staples is driving demand for essential products, consumer spending on big-ticket categories such as furniture, home and sporting goods has been choppy, hurting sales at Costco's warehouses.

The company's same-store sales are also taking a hit from lower gasoline prices, which squeeze their margins. They grew 5.4% in the reported period, compared with a 6.6% rise in the third quarter.

Costco reported quarterly revenue of $79.70 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $79.97 billion, according to LSEG data.

How do dividend stocks pay? ,"Hi all, so I'm looking to move my cash paying stocks Into dividend stocks. My portfolio is fairly balanced with my largest portion  in efts.

I'm looking at moving my S&P 500 stocks from cash to dividend paying. 

The stocks I found for dividend paying are much larger to purchase. So I could purchase 10 or so. Now if they pay dividends, does that mean the stock goes up in value? Rather than paying say 1 or a portion of a stock.

As you can't buy a portion of a stock, does this mean I'd need a much larger portfolio to start with these? Or can they pay a portion? 

Probably a simple question, but all advice I've found simply it's pays dividends back into the fund. 

I started back in 2020 slowly dip feeding my account with payments.

I'm mortgage free in 7 years. And want to get a headstand, before I up my payments after my house is secure. Aiming for 20-30 years, post mortgage. 

So long term, I would rather be in the dividend side.

Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it,"Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend 

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals

- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not 

- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships",893,306,1727366185.0

Ubisoft Shares Sink to Decade Low After ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Delay ,"Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the French video game company cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and delayed the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows.

Shares fell 19% to €9.25 at 10:27 a.m. in Paris on Thursday, the lowest since November 2013.

While Assassin’s Creed Shadows is “feature complete,” it will now debut Feb. 14 2025, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The game was initially planned for November. The company said it needed more time to improve the game after its recent Star Wars release had underperformed.

Ubisoft has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles. Pushing back the latest Assassin’s Creed title means it skips the lucrative holiday period.

Ubisoft said it now expects bookings of €1.95 billion ($2.2 billion) in fiscal 2025, which ends in March. Analysts were expecting €2.42 billion, on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.

Net bookings in the fiscal second quarter are now projected to be €350 million to €370 million, the company said. It previously forecast about €550 million.

The revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the softer-than-expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,” Ubisoft said.

Star Wars received middling reviews after its August launch. Ubisoft said it would strive to avoid similar mistakes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of the holiday season.

“This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition,” according to Ubisoft. Unlike prior entries in the Assassin’s Creed series, the upcoming title will not include a Season Pass, which supplied new content in exchange for an added fee.

The latest guidance miss is Ubisoft’s fifth in six years, said analysts Doug Creutz and Mei Lun Quach from TD Cowen. The board has not held management accountable for “repeated failures in a way that serves the interest of external shareholders,” they added.

“Ubisoft has both high-quality game IP and talented developers; despite that, the last six years have been an almost non-stop parade of game delays, followed by game launches that are still undercooked, as well as misallocation of capital to games that probably never should have been green-lit in the first place,” they said.

Let's discuss - investing psychology/behavioural pitfalls that we fall into,"I find myself in a somewhat odd investment psychology pitfall or trap that is the opportunity cost or FOMO of potential gains, but not losses.

I have had paper losses in my investments of up to five digits are some points, which doesn't bother me emotionally or psychologically at all. However, when it comes to losing out to potential gains, it hits me with almost crippling anxiety and frustration.

For example, 

- selling off a stock after it had made a profit, to see that the price continues to appreciate shortly after,

- taking a stop loss to see that the stock makes a recovery in the very near term (immediate to say 2 weeks out),

- considering and hesitating on buying a stock, to see that it has shot up before I could come to an investment decision whether to buy.

I think what I find strange about this psychology is that I am mentally able to handle paper losses but not the ability to just shake off gains that 'could have been', even though I hadn't actually made any losses or even made smaller gains than what it potentially got to in the near future. 

I guess by writing it down, I am trying to verbalise my thoughts and emotions to make sense of it, deal with it, hopefully overcome it, and would like hear from others what goes through their minds when they are doing investments.

Do you experience any investing psychology or pitfalls yourself?

Anyone else been in a similar mental state as I am, and how did you overcome it if you did?

OpenAI restructuring to For-Profit from Non-Profit and Microsoft Impact,"How will OpenAI going to a for-profit from non-profit impact Microsoft stock price? Does this open the door to some larger partnership between the two?

Altman is quoted as previously saying, the company’s non-profit ownership structure protects the company from the short-term interests of shareholders. The non-profit ownership structure also ensures that the benefits accrued from artificial intelligence (AI) would be distributed broadly, AI systems’ safety would be assured, and OpenAI would work to serve the “best interests of humanity.”

"Meta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype ","Meta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company’s Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor.

The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it’ll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023′s Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February.

In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot.

Meta’s previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company’s spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms.

Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple’s entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn’t revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.

What it does

A Meta representative said the “S” in Quest 3S stands for “start” — as in getting started with VR.

Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple’s Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset.

Meta highlighted improved “passthrough,” the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough.

The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console.

“All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,” Zuckerberg said.

In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta’s app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta’s controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn’t pressing buttons.

Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last’s year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S.

Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.

Eventually, glasses

Zuckerberg’s justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world.

Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said.

Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won’t be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell.

“This is where we are going,” Zuckerberg said.

Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company’s first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be.

Orion is Meta’s first “fully-functioning” prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small “puck.” The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company’s 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs.

Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said.

Meta’s Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device.

This isn’t the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.

Meta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don’t have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company’s voice assistant.

As part of Wednesday’s event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses.

For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user’s ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes.

Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. 

Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. 

Those features will become available “later this year,” the company said.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were “a bigger hit sooner than expected.”

Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.

AI that speaks

Zuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts.

With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta’s apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone.

For Meta AI’s new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell.

The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.

The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service.

Meta’s new chatbot features are based on the company’s AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people’s written prompts.

Amphastar (AMPH) growth potential 2025 onwards,"Here is full weekend analysis I completed recently. Enjoy

**DESCRIPTION**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing, manufacturing, and selling generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. The company also provides insulin APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredient) used in the development of injectable finished pharmaceutical products. A key driver of Amphastar's recent performance is its acquisition of BAQSIMI®, **the first and only** nasally administered glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes.

**Executive Summary**

Amphastar continues to leverage its technical expertise in complex generics and proprietary products. The company announced net revenues of $644.4 million for 2023, a substantial increase from $499.0 million in 2022. Similarly, financial results for the second quarter of 2024 are similarly strong, with net revenues growing to $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the prior year. The recent acquisition of BAQSIMI® and the company’s expanding product line signal continued growth.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capitalize on its diverse portfolio of over 25 commercial products, robust pipeline, and growing manufacturing capabilities. While the company's recent acquisitions, such as BAQSIMI®, and its focus on niche markets have strengthened its position in the injectable and inhalation markets, further developments and successful integration of these strategic moves will be crucial in determining its leadership in these sectors.

**Market At Large**

Amphastar Pharmaceuticals falls under the pharmaceuticals industry and can be classified as a drug manufacturer that specializes in both specialty pharmaceuticals and generic drugs.

The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow significantly, driven by an aging population, and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes. The U.S. injectable drug market was valued at $340 billion in 2023, with Amphastar targeting over $11 billion in opportunities within the space. Additionally, the U.S. inhalation market is valued at $29 billion, where Amphastar’s Primatene MIST® has captured significant market share. The injectable drug market alone is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in the next decade.

Research supports the findings in annual reports. Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. In 2022, published by Parker et al. on November 1st, 2023, stated that In 2022, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. was $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, 1 in 4 health care dollars spent in the U.S. is related to the care of individuals diagnosed with diabetes, with 61% of these costs being directly attributable to diabetes.

Amphastar is well-positioned to capture a share of this growing market due to its focus on diabetes-related products, particularly with its acquisition of BAQSIMI®. With diabetes care accounting for such a significant portion of healthcare spending, Amphastar’s expanding presence in this space provides a substantial growth opportunity.

**Company & Business Description**

Amphastar’s diversified product line includes injectable, intranasal, and inhalation products. Its portfolio spans over 25 marketed products, including Primatene MIST®, BAQSIMI®, Glucagon for Injection, and REXTOVYTM. The company’s pipeline includes over 20 product candidates, many of which leverage Amphastar’s core strengths in drug delivery technology, particle engineering, and API manufacturing.

Amphastar’s business model includes both selling proprietary products and manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which are sold to other pharmaceutical companies.

Key strengths include its vertically integrated infrastructure, which enables the company to oversee all stages of product development from research through commercialization. Amphastar's international expansion is highlighted by the acquisition of BAQSIMI®, which is sold in 27 countries.

**Management**

Jack Y. Zhang, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, has led the company since 1996. With over 35 years of experience in chemistry and management, Dr. Zhang has driven Amphastar’s growth through his deep technical expertise and leadership. He holds several patents and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Founder-led businesses like Amphastar often outperform peers due to the founder’s personal stake, long-term vision, and deep understanding of the company. Dr. Zhang’s leadership, combining scientific knowledge and operational management, is a key driver of Amphastar’s success.

**Financial Statements**

Amphastar’s financial performance in 2023 was marked by strong revenue growth and profitability. Total net revenues were $644.4 million, with a gross margin of 49.7%. The company’s net income reached $137.5 million, a significant increase from $91.4 million in 2022.

For Q2 2024, Amphastar reported total revenues of $182.4 million, a 25% increase from the same period in 2023. Gross profit also saw a substantial rise to $95.2 million, representing a 31% gross margin, up from $72.7 million a year ago. This was mainly driven by the growth in the sale of BAQSIMI® and Primatene MIST® along with robust performance from its insulin API business.

The company’s balance sheet remains solid, with cash and equivalents of $189.6 million as of June 30, 2024. Amphastar can comfortably cover its current liabilities, but the company has significant long-term debt primarily due to the acquisition of BAQSIMI®. While the company has been actively managing its debt, the liquidity position is still strong, allowing Amphastar to invest in R&D and consider further strategic acquisitions or product development.

Amphastar’s retained earnings grew significantly, reaching $490.4 million as of June 30, 2024, up from $409.3 million at the end of 2023. This is is a positive indicator of profitability and financial health.

Amphastar has $255.8 million in treasury stock, up from $247.4 million at the end of 2023. This increase reflects the company’s continued buyback activity, demonstrating confidence in its own stock and a commitment to enhancing shareholder value by reducing the outstanding share count.

The company reported -$24.3 million in net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2024. Despite not issuing new shares, Amphastar made debt-related payments (including principal repayments on long-term debt), engaged in share buybacks, and made equity plan payments. The absence of new common share issuance can be a positive signal for investors, as it shows the company is not diluting existing shareholders, and the continued share repurchases signal management’s confidence in the company's future.

**BAQSIMI® Acquisition**

BAQSIMI® (glucagon), a dry nasal spray used in an emergency for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in people with diabetes ages four years and above, is the first and only nasally administered glucagon. It is compact, portable and ready to use in a single, fixed 3mg dose.

On June 30, 2023, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals completed the acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly & Company. The total deal value was $628.1 million, including a $500 million upfront cash payment, deferred payments, and potential contingent payments of up to $450 million based on sales milestones:

1. *$100 million*: If annual net sales of BAQSIMI® and related products reach $175 million within the first five years after acquisition.
2. *Two payments of $100 million each*: If annual net sales reach $200 million in any year during the same period.
3. *$150 million*: If cumulative net sales of $950 million are achieved within the first five years.

In addition, the company entered into agreements with Lilly to ensure a smooth transition, including a Manufacturing Services Agreement for continued production and a Transition Services Agreement to support clinical and commercial operations for up to 18 months.

BAQSIMI® strengthens Amphastar’s position in the diabetes care market, providing immediate revenue growth and expanding the company’s global footprint into 27 countries. The company expects BAQSIMI® to generate substantial long-term value, with a product lifespan of 24 years.

The deal was funded through a $700 million credit facility, demonstrating the company’s financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth opportunities.

**BAQSIMI® Sales 2021-2024**

The sales data for BAQSIMI® has been sourced from both Eli Lilly and Amphastar’s annual and quarterly reports. 

Noteworthy points include:

* 2022 Full Year: BAQSIMI® generated $252.7 million in total sales, with $207 million coming from the U.S. and $45.7 million from international markets.
* 2023 Q2: Eli Lilly reported a significant sales surge of $613.9 million as the company worked to deplete its inventory following the announcement of BAQSIMI®'s sale to Amphastar.
* 2023 Full Year: Total sales for BAQSIMI® amounted to $746.4 million.
* 2024 H1: Sales slowed, totaling $61.9 million by mid-year, likely reflecting transitional factors associated with the Manufacturing and Transition Services Agreements between Eli Lilly and Amphastar.

This data highlights the fluctuations in BAQSIMI® sales leading up to its full transfer to Amphastar in 2025, where a more consistent growth trajectory is expected.

**Future Outlook**

Total revenues from finished pharmaceutical products for 2023, 2022, and 2021 amounted to $579.1 million, $486.5 million and $419.6 million, respectively. This is significant as it forms the baseline revenue for Amphastar's core business.

Amphastar’s acquisition of BAQSIMI® from Eli Lilly is expected to significantly boost its revenue starting in 2025, once the company takes over the manufacturing and direct sales. Prior to Amphastar's control, Eli Lilly's inventory depletion efforts in 2023 Q2 led to an extraordinary $613.9 million in total BAQSIMI® sales. However, the drop in sales afterward reflects a period where Eli Lilly’s sales incentives waned due to the transitional agreements, resulting in lower sales during 2023 H2 and 2024 H1.

**Once Amphastar assumes full control in 2025 Q1, the alignment of sales incentives will likely restore BAQSIMI’s growth trajectory.**

BAQSIMI®’s future potential is substantial, particularly as the glucagon market grows and Amphastar expands all its products internationally, especially in China and Europe. This acquisition aligns with Amphastar's long-term strategy of expanding its branded product portfolio, improving operational efficiencies, and capturing high-margin niche markets.

**Valuation**

Given Amphastar's current P/E of 15.30 and forward P/E of 17x based on 2024 estimates. I disagree with analysts on that because BAQSIMI® is likely to be accretive to earnings starting from 2025 more than expected.

My Sales Scenarios for 2025-2029:

1. Moderate Growth Scenario:

Amphastar steadily grows BAQSIMI® sales from $200 million in 2025 to $400 million by 2029.

Existing products grow at a stable rate of around 5% year-over-year, starting from $579.1 million in 2023.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $400 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.13 billion

2) Optimistic Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® hits $250 million in 2025 and reaches $500 million by 2029.

Existing products maintain a similar growth trajectory.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $500 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.23 billion

3) Aggressive Growth Scenario:

BAQSIMI® reaches $300 million by 2025 and $700 million by 2029, reflecting the higher sales potential.

Existing product revenues remain steady, growing alongside BAQSIMI®.

Total Projected Revenue by 2029:

BAQSIMI®: $700 million

Existing products: \~$730 million

Total Revenue: $1.43 billion

Rationale:

* **Existing Product Sales**: Amphastar’s diversified product portfolio is generating strong and stable revenues. This provides a solid foundation for the company’s future growth.
* **BAQSIMI® Contribution**: Given its potential as a high-margin product, BAQSIMI® will accelerate Amphastar’s revenue growth and drive profitability once manufacturing and sales incentives are aligned in 2025.
* **Synergies**: The company’s strategy of expanding its branded portfolio and increasing its presence in niche markets supports its premium valuation, especially with BAQSIMI®’s global market potential.

Amphastar’s diversification into proprietary products, combined with its ability to navigate regulatory processes and execute complex acquisitions, adds a premium to its valuation.

If Amphastar can achieve the optimistic or aggressive revenue growth projections, along with corresponding improvements in profitability, it is likely that the market will recognize this performance by significantly re-rating the stock. Companies that demonstrate sustained top-line and bottom-line growth, particularly in high-margin, high-demand segments, often command higher valuation multiples. In such cases, it would not be unusual for Amphastar to enjoy a P/E ratio of 30 or higher, in line with other high-growth pharmaceutical companies that successfully capitalize on niche market leadership and product innovation.

**Risks**

* **Supply Chain Constraints**: Amphastar relies on single-source suppliers for key raw materials, especially for complex products like BAQSIMI®. Any disruptions could impact production and sales, particularly during the transition post-acquisition.
* **Price Sensitivity**: Pricing pressures from healthcare reforms and competition, including biosimilars, could affect margins. Maintaining BAQSIMI®'s profitability in a competitive market will be essential.
* **Geopolitical Risks**: The company’s operations in China are vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions, which could affect manufacturing and supply chain stability.
* **Competitive Pressure**: Increased competition from larger pharmaceutical companies could erode market share, especially in glucagon products like BAQSIMI®.
* **Regulatory Risks**: Delays in regulatory approvals for new products and BAQSIMI®’s integration in international markets could impact sales timelines.
* **Acquisition Integration**: Smooth integration of BAQSIMI® post-transition is critical to achieving projected sales growth. Any delays could hinder short-term performance.

**CATALYSTS**

* **Successful integration and ramp-up of BAQSIMI®:** With BAQSIMI® expected to significantly contribute to revenues post-2025, its integration and performance under Amphastar’s management will be critical.
* **REXTOVY™ approval and commercial launch:** The rollout of this naloxone nasal spray product will diversify Amphastar’s emergency treatment offerings and strengthen its foothold in opioid overdose treatments.
* **Expansion of Primatene MIST® and insulin biosimilars:** Continued growth in these key product lines, along with new biosimilars in the pipeline, will drive future revenue streams and enhance market penetration.
* **Strategic international expansion through BAQSIMI® channels:** Amphastar’s ability to leverage BAQSIMI®’s established presence in over 27 countries will be instrumental in accelerating international growth.
* **Ongoing share repurchases:** The company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through stock buybacks will further enhance investor confidence.",9,0,1727278351.0
Google files EU antitrust complaint accusing Microsoft of stifling cloud competition ,"Google filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.

At the heart of Google’s complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to “lock in” clients and exert control over the cloud market.

Google alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.

The internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft’s cloud licensing terms makes it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to competitors’ clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.

European businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers’ ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.

The antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.

Referring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission to dismiss Google’s complaint.

“Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. “Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.”

Microsoft’s cloud ‘tax’ at issue

In a summary of the complaint, Google — which ranks third globally in the cloud computing market behind market leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, respectively — said that Microsoft “harms cybersecurity and undermines innovation.”

According to Google, if a company runs Microsoft’s Office suite of productivity tools and other applications on Google Cloud Platform or other competing clouds, they are effectively required to pay a “tax” in the form of punchy licensing fees to Microsoft.

Google said that Microsoft undermined competition in cloud, and referred to findings of a U.K. Competition and Markets Authority study which determined Microsoft acquired over 60% to 70% of all new British businesses in 2021 and 2022.

Google also suggested that Microsoft’s cloud practices have potentially made businesses more prone to security issues.

In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Wednesday, Amit Zavery, Google Cloud’s head of platform, said Google believes Microsoft is “100%” in violation of EU antitrust rules.

“We would like the cloud market to remain and become very vibrant and open for all the providers including European vendors, vendors like us, AWS and others,” Zavery said.

“Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” Zavery said. “Today the restrictions does not allow choice for customers,” he said, adding that Microsoft included restrictions once it realized the massive commercial potential of the technology.

“So, we would want those restrictions to be removed and allow customers to have and choose whatever cloud provider they think is best for them commercially and technically,” he added.

Zavery told CNBC that if Microsoft makes changes to its cloud licensing terms as a result of its complaint, Google and cloud customers more broadly would be “very happy.”

Following the July settlement agreement with Microsoft, CISPE said the tech giant would work with its members to release an enhanced version of Azure Stack HCI, a cloud infrastructure product, to offer the same features that Microsoft customers using its Azure product currently benefit from.

Google, which is not a CISPE member, said it disagreed with the settlement and chose not to participate in the agreement. Amazon Web Services, which is a CISPE member, and Alibaba’s cloud unit AliCloud, also chose not to become part of the settlement.

For its part, Microsoft has denied that its cloud practices harm competition. In response to a cloud market study initiated by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority, the firm said that it “firmly believes that the cloud services market is functioning well.”

Boeing losing '$100 million to $150 million a day' as union strike rolls on,"Boeing (BA) finds itself stuck between a rock and a hard place as the labor strike between it and the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union nears a second week.

On Monday, Boeing upped its offer to the union, which represents 33,000 workers, but did not proceed through union leadership and instead sent a ""best and final"" offer directly to workers, which didn’t sit well with the IAM. Boeing’s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.

""The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,"" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.""

Earlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in “direct talks” after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.

Nevertheless, Boeing’s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Shareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.

“Boeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they’re losing between $100 million and $150 million,” Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.

Without union workers based in Boeing’s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company’s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.

Mendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.

“It’s not just Boeing that’s in trouble — the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,” Mendiratta said. “When there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.”

Mendiratta doesn’t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing’s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.

IAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.

With the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.

Okta Lost Over $8B Due To Security Scandals In Three Years – Can It Ever Be Okay Again?,"I think everyone here remembers Okta's scandalous security issues.

Southwest Airlines to cut service and staffing in Atlanta to slash costs,"Southwest Airlines is planning to reduce service to and from Atlanta next year, cutting more than 300 pilot and flight attendant positions, according to a company memo seen by CNBC.

The changes come a day before Southwest’s investor day, when executives will map out the company’s plan to cut costs and grow revenue as pressure mounts from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.

Southwest told staff it isn’t closing its crew base in Atlanta. Instead, it will reducing staffing by as many as 200 flight attendants and as many as 140 pilots, for the April 2025 bid month.

Southwest isn’t laying the crews off, but they will likely have to bid to work from other cities.

“Although we try everything we can before making difficult decisions like this one, we simply cannot afford continued losses and must make this change to help restore our profitability,” Southwest said in its memo. “This decision in no way reflects our Employees’ performance, and we’re proud of the Hospitality and the efforts they have made and will continue to make with our Customers in ATL.”

DoJ to allege Visa monopolized U.S. debit card market - report

Sept 24 (Reuters) - Visa (V.N), opens new tab shares fell 3% on Tuesday after a report said the U.S. Department of Justice plans to file a lawsuit against the world's largest payment processor, alleging it illegally monopolized the country's debit-card market.

The antitrust division of the regulator is set to file a lawsuit as soon as Tuesday, accusing Visa of a range of anti-competitive conduct, Bloomberg News reported, opens new tabon Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

""We believe this is an immediate negative to shares but we caution these types of antitrust cases are notoriously known for long/winding paths in the U.S.,"" boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

FRESH ANTITRUST SCRUTINY

The company has been facing heightened scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for years, battling allegations of a duopoly with Mastercard (MA.N), opens new tab . Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.
""The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.

""It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.""

News of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.
Brokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.
The prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to ""see the intentions of the next administration,"" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.

""If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.""

Mastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.

Clear Secure (YOU) Stock analysis. what do you think about the company?,"Clear Secure (YOU), Stock analysis  (i dont own any shares of clear)

  

Is a biometric security company which means it produces eye and fingerprint scanners but clear secure markets them skillfully. At airports there are extra clear booths where you can confirm your identity via scanner if you have a clear plus membership and thus skip the line for normal government identity confirmation at the airport.  

  

Clear secure benefits:  

  

Clear secure benefits from unorganized airports by offering a short queue with which you can get identified by eye scan and thus do not have to wait the normal often long waiting time.   

  

Identity checks at airports are already overloaded with queues sometimes hours long and every year more people will travel and fly so it may be worthwhile for people who travel often to buy a Clear plus membership.  

  

So far, clear scanners are only available at 60 airports in the US, so they have a long way to go to expand  

  

Even though their offer is very expensive (199 dollars per year) and only worth it for people who fly 5 times or more per year, you can get it cheaper with credit cards or other offers, for example with tsa precheck in the offer.   

  

clear secure is also partnering with tsa precheck so in the future they can also take over the check-in of tsa precheck subscribers on behalf of tsa precheck which can be a good way to market clear plus and also shows a good cooperation between clear secure and the government.  

  

For the airports, clear secure is also a win because it brings in a lot of money and with decreasing parking revenue, the airports can replace other revenue streams that are getting lower.  

  

Their scan technology can also be used in various locations such as stadiums, offices, stands, etc. they have created a kind of ecosystem with the aim that in the future you can identify yourself everywhere with your face via clear secure and confirm your data such as age identity and vaccination status. other possible locations would be healthcare, clubs casinos etc. so far clear is already active in several stadiums and interesting partnerships are perhaps those with LinkedIn at LinkedIn you can log into your account via clear secure scan for a year now. You can also register at home depot locations using clear secure. what is interesting here is the way in which the manegment is introducing clear secure in different areas, which shows how many places you can use clear scan technology  

  

clear's ceo has been ceo since 2010 and she initiated all the things that make clear the company it is today  

  

Another interesting point is that clear secure has no direct competitors in this type of business other companies that also sell biometric security services such as facial iris and fingerprint scans serve the us government for example IDEMIA and Thales Group also help with their scans at border control or help with tsa checks at the airport they sell to the government but only the technology.  

  

while clear secure pioneered a commercialized customer-facing system with purchasable premium memberships and stand-alone queues at the airport.   

  

As for the clear plus membership retention rate, last year in Q2 it was 90% and has dropped to 80% this year due to a price increase. of course i hope that this trend will not continue but i assume that in the future the retention rate will remain between 80-90%.  

  

Price increases are nothing unusual for Clear but since 2010 the price of the clear plus membership has only been increased twice while the product has grown from two extra lines to 60 extra lines. this year clear has also added a perk to the celar plus membership. there are some discounts for third party services through the membership and there is also a free search service that you can call if you realize you have forgotten or lost something at the airport and they will look it up on their own or help you find it. These perks are nothing earth-shattering, but they at least increase the value of your membership  

  

Balance sheet or income statement related:  

  

Since 2019 they have tripled the revenue from 192 million to 697 million even if I don't expect such a rapid growth Clear can still grow for many years with an annual growth rate of 10-20% as they still have many easy expansion opportunities and their market cap is only 3 billion  

  

Clear has no debt on the balance sheet  

  

  

Clear has a fcf margin of 38% and even though they have issued 2.5% shares this year, 11.5% last year and 7.27% the year before last, now that they are so profitable they want to go other ways and buy back shares. in the earnings call the cfo also said that they are doing this because they want to be shareholder friendly in the long term.  

  

Even if they have done so much equity funding in the last few years, at least their cash flow has grown faster, which is why their fcf per share has grown by an average of 30 percent in the last three years.  

  

Clear secure disadvantages:  

  

One disadvantage that Clear secure definitely has is pricing their premium membership costs 199 dollars per year, if you look at platforms like reddit or trustpilot one reason for the one star rating is that it is expensive and not worth the price.  

  

or normal consumers this is true even if you assume that the average family flies maybe twice a year it is not worth it for them because that 199 dollars is also a larger percentage of their annual income. This definitely limits clear secures customer base to wealthier people who would just do anything at the airport to make it go faster or maybe people who have to fly very often due to their job so their cost per use is so low that it's worth it  

  

Another concern started with a case in 2022 in which a man who wanted to smuggle ammunition despite a false identity tricked such a clear secure scanner, which of course caused the share price to fall sharply and also with a reason: if the machines are not 100% secure, you don't need them. Clear Secure responded quickly with a new system that scans not only the eyes and fingerprints but also the face, assuring clear secure that they are 100% secure even though no major case has happened since then and face scanning is also relatively secure, clear secure is of course now subject to stricter controls and if such a case happens again, clear secure could be punished more severely.  

  

Another threat is that airports could become more efficient so that a costly overhaul line like clear is no longer needed as mentioned earlier many biometric security companies sell their technology to the government and with enough of these scanners equipped the queues should not be that long. Firstly, of course we don't know what the future holds, but airports have always been completely overcrowded during the peak travel times and I don't see that changing  

  

The last and I think also one of the strongest contra points against investing in clear secure is:  

  

in the end, clear secure at airports (their main buisness) is an overtaking rod for those who want to afford it and that is of course a thorn in the side of every people-oriented politician.   

  

airports are financed by tax money and so instead of offering clear secure for the money, they should make the airport more efficient in general. but if an airport earns millions a year from its clear secure line, why should it do that? For the population that can't afford clear secure, that's obviously bad.  

  

In addition, according to some, the state should not hand over its security processes to private companies, but as far as that is concerned, I don't believe that clear secure lines will be abolished by airports in the future either. clear secure works closely with the state programs tsa and tsa precheck, as I said, in the future clear staff will be able to check in tsa precheck members and there are already lines in cooperation with tsa precheck that combine the two advantages so that there is a clear plus + tsa precheck line at several airports.  

  

Voluation:  

  

Clear secure PE ratio is 42 and the P/FCF ratio is 11, this big difference is due to the fact that clear secure has become profitable very quickly in the last few years in terms of free cash flow and the net income margin is not quite there yet while the FCF margin is just at 38% the net income margin is still at 10% stock based compensation is also not really meaningful that it would make such a difference.  

  

In the future, the FCF margin should in any case remain between 40% and 30% and the net income margin should also move up to 30%.  

  

Conclusion  

  

I am actually interested in the company and could also imagine opening a clear secur position in the future, as I expect a long period of sales growth and the risk factors outweigh the positive aspects.

“As we look to the future, we are confident that Blackstone and Vista’s expertise and resources will help us ensure Smartsheet remains a great place to work where our employees thrive,” CEO Mark Mader said in a release. Shares rose 6% on the news.

The transaction has a 45-day go-shop period, allowing Smartsheet to solicit other bidders. Barring another offer, the transaction is expected to close by January 2025, pending shareholder approval.

Qatalyst advised Smartsheet. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised the private equity bidders.

"Shorting Financial, Technology, and Real Estate stocks is probably a bad idea with Fed interest rates trending down.","* Shorting stocks involves profiting from falling stock prices by selling stocks the sellers **do not own**.
* Sellers usually use margin loans for those stocks with **interest charges accruing** as long as the position is not closed.  Those interest charges do have to be paid and eat into the potential profit or worsen the loss of shorting a stock.
* Brokerage firms can **impose margin calls** if the stock being shorted rises in price requiring **additional capital** to maintain the shorting position.  The broker has the **right to close out the position** if that capital is not met.
* The **sky is the limit** for potential loss.  If a stock rises several folds then it will cost several times the price of that stock to close out the position.  It **can bankrupt** a person who is willing to take that gambling risk.
* **Fed interest rate trending down benefits** the ***Financial***, ***Technology***, and ***Real Estate*** stock sectors the most.
* The **50 bp drop last Wednesday drastically increased** the chance of a **softer landing** and the **probability of the high-growth stocks, especially in the Financial and Technology sectors emerging with explosive growth**.
* Betting against Financial and Technology stocks, especially high-growth stocks **can literally decimate a person's life savings or worse bankrupt someone** who has a heavy position in shorting those stocks.
* **Any positive company news, good EPS, Fed interest rate drop, and general positive market trend are just a few examples** that can put a short seller into carrying a **huge debt**.
* Investment in a stock with high potential can be the best decision anyone can ever make.  But **betting with money you don't have and wishing a stock to go down with the possibility of bankrupting yourself and/or burned your family's life savings is just a bad idea**.",0,11,1727174627.0
"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Sep 24, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

"Why has apples equity been going down?
","I was looking at the balance sheet of apple in a video I was watching and it showed that apples equity has been going down a lot from 2017 to 2021 .When they looked closer at the equity statements they concluded that it was because they were doing large share buybacks, so cash was used to buy the stock ie assets were reduced as cash is an asset.

However even though cash was used to buyback stocks , the stock in itself is also an asset and the price of apple stock has only gone up from 2017 to 2021 so this should more than counteract the effect of assets reduction due to cash being used to buy back shares and thus equity really shouldn't have changed significantly because of that .",117,53,1727027340.0

"20% spy, 20% qqqm, 30% schd, 30 %iwm not long term","My thoughts are about what I hear should do well now/soon.  IWM small cap because of rate cuts, SCHD because it has under performed compared to some other etfs.. same about IWM.. so buying on a discount relative to SPY and QQQM.  Rate cuts should help small cap.  Buying SCHD when it hasn’t grown as fast as SPY so hopefully getting dividend stocks to keep at a lower price anticipating SCHD to go up.  This also reduces the exposure to tech compared to just SPY /QQQM .. or a 25%, 25%,25%,25% allocation to SPY, SCHD,IWM, QQQM by about 6% because tech has ran so huge.. it has to slow down at some point…I also want to get more real estate as it is only 2.8 % but I’ll work on that with a few hand picked ones probably.  This 30,30,20,20 split also slightly increases financials, and industrials which as I understand should preform better in a rate cut environment.

This is what I come up with I’m my research and how I think may be a good way to play it. 

Please give me your honest thoughts.  

Also I am expecting the market will go down some until the election so I will keep a lot of cash on the side..dca into these once a week with a little under half what I plan on putting into it between now and the election… the remaining amount I will be taking advantage of any drops in any of these etfs… which will undoubtedly throw my percentages off which is ok.. I will allow any of them to vary within reason.. if any start to get to much I’ll cut back.. or if any get to little I’ll put more into it.. 

Ty and if this looks a little higher on risk.. I am ok with that because I am hoping for more risk more reward.. without being to risky

I'm curious:

* Do you buy this version of events? 
* If you didn't believe Powell's story that ""economy is fine"" does anything Waller say here change your mind?
* How will the stock and bond markets react?

Citing recent data on consumer and producer prices, Waller told CNBC that the data is showing core inflation, excluding food and energy, in the Fed’s preferred measure is running below 1.8% over the past four months. The Fed targets annual inflation at 2%.

“That is what put me back a bit to say, wow, inflation is softening much faster than I thought it was going to, and that is what put me over the edge to say, look, I think 50 [basis points] is the right thing to do,” Waller said during an interview with CNBC’s Steve Liesman.

Both the consumer and producer price indexes showed increases of 0.2% for the month. On a 12-month basis, the CPI ran at a 2.5% rate.

However, Waller said the more recent data has shown an even stronger trend lower, thus giving the Fed space to ease more as it shifts its focus to supporting the softening labor market.

A week before the Fed meeting, markets were overwhelmingly pricing in a 25 basis point cut. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“The point is, we do have room to move, and that is what the committee is signaling,” he said.",345,86,1726871212.0

PLTR index inclusion - easy 9% upside?,"Basis: [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/..septembershuffle546.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20240906-1474143/1474143_septembershuffle546.pdf) 

Please correct/ comment on plain math below.

PLTR is 82B market cap, soon to be included in SP-500 index. I don't know how many trillions are parked in this index, via funds and ETFs, but that should at least be $9T.

As of 2021, this number was $5.4T

[https://www.axios.com/2021/07/07/sp-500-index-funds-record](https://www.axios.com/2021/07/07/sp-500-index-funds-record)

Today, just the top 5 index ETFs from Vanguard, Schwab, Fidelity, give a total of over $3T.

So, just 0.1% weight in SP-500 would mean inflows of $9B to a company. Since PLTR's market cap today is close to $82B, doesn't this mean, an obvious 9% jump when ETFs and funds *have to* buy this stock?",14,27,1726861979.0

Inflation moving sustainably to 2%,"Got an economics question for you all.  Sounds like Powell is satisfied with inflation moving sustainably to 2%, and was apparently (at least on the surface) so thrilled by that progress that he cut rates 0.5%.  

However, looking at core CPI, it appears to still be stuck above 3%.  https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/united-states-core-inflation-rates/

Granted, headline CPI is more like 2.5%, but that factors in energy, which is notoriously volatile.  All we need is some nasty war, and oil can spike like it did in 2022.  For that reason, I had understood that core CPI is usually considered more reliable.

Finally, I understand that the Fed prefers core PCE, and the difference there with core CPI is unclear.  Anyway, core PCE has been stuck at 2.6% for months too.
https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-pce-price-index-905/

That is, no further progress seems to be made, and Core PCE still seems considerably higher than the pre-2021 numbers, which were more in the 1.5% to 2.0% range even before the COVID disruptions.


What are your thoughts on this inflation situation?  (I am not referring to whether you think the stock market will go up or down, but more whether you agree with Powell that inflation is tamed, or if I am missing something key about the trajectory of inflation.)

> The Federal Trade Commission on Friday sued three large U.S. health companies that negotiate insulin prices, arguing the drug middlemen boost their profits while “artificially” inflating costs for patients.  The suit targets the three biggest so-called pharmacy benefit managers, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx, CVS Health’s
 Caremark and Cigna’s Express Scripts. All are owned by or connected to health insurers and collectively administer about 80% of the nation’s prescriptions, according to the FTC.  The FTC’s lawsuit also includes each PBM’s affiliated group purchasing organization, which brokers drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers. PBMs sit at the center of the drug supply chain in the U.S. They negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, large employers and federal health plans. They also create lists of medications, or formularies, that are covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions. The FTC has been investigating PBMs since 2022. 

> The agency’s suit argues that the three PBMs have created a “perverse” drug rebate system that prioritizes high rebates from drugmakers, which leads to “artificially inflated insulin list prices.” It also alleges that PBMs favor those high-list-price insulins even when more affordable insulins with lower list prices become available.  “Millions of Americans with diabetes need insulin to survive, yet for many of these vulnerable patients, their insulin drug costs have skyrocketed over the past decade thanks in part to powerful PBMs and their greed,” Rahul Rao, deputy director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.  “The FTC’s administrative action seeks to put an end to the Big Three PBMs’ exploitative conduct and marks an important step in fixing a broken system—a fix that could ripple beyond the insulin market and restore healthy competition to drive down drug prices for consumers,” Rao continued. 

> The FTC said it also remains “deeply troubled” by the role insulin manufacturers like Eli Lilly, Danish company Novo Nordisk and French drugmaker Sanofi  play in higher list prices, according to a release from the agency. The three companies control roughly 90% of the U.S. insulin market.",358,63,1726849097.0
NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Financial Round Tripping | Thematics,"# Background

It's crucial to understand the concept of financial round-tripping and its implications for the market. Round-tripping is a deceptive practice that has gained notoriety in recent years due to its potential to mislead investors and manipulate financial statements. This fraudulent technique involves creating artificial transactions between two or more entities to inflate revenues, evade taxes, or present a false picture of financial health.

Typically, round-tripping occurs when a company sells an asset to another entity while simultaneously agreeing to buy back the same or a similar asset at approximately the same price. This creates the illusion of bustling business activity and growth, which can be particularly attractive to speculative investors. However, these transactions lack genuine economic substance and violate the fundamental accounting principle of substance over form. Round-tripping has been implicated in several high-profile financial scandals, including those involving energy traders like Enron and CMS Energy, as well as financial service providers such as Wirecard. As an investment advisor, it's essential to be vigilant and look for red flags that might indicate round-tripping, such as unusually high revenue growth without corresponding increases in cash flow or profit margins.

**The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping**. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# History of Financial Round Tripping in Tech

 Over the past 20 years, several high-profile cases of round-tripping have emerged in the technology sector, highlighting the prevalence of this deceptive practice. Here are some notable examples:

# Enron Scandal (2001)

While not strictly a tech company, Enron's collapse involved significant round-tripping in energy trading. The company engaged in numerous sham transactions with special purpose entities to inflate revenues and hide debt. These transactions involved selling assets to these entities and then buying them back at similar prices, creating the illusion of bustling business activity.

# Global Crossing (2002)

This telecommunications company was accused of swapping network capacity with other carriers to artificially boost revenue. Global Crossing would sell capacity on its network to another carrier while simultaneously buying an equal amount of capacity from that carrier, with no money changing hands. This practice inflated reported revenues without generating actual cash flow.

# Qwest Communications (2002-2004)

The telecom giant was found to have engaged in round-trip transactions involving the swapping of fiber-optic capacity with other companies. These deals were structured to appear as legitimate sales and purchases, but in reality, they were designed to inflate revenues artificially.

# Computer Associates (2004)

The software company was involved in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud that included round-tripping. They used a practice called the ""35-day month,"" where they kept their books open for an extra few days to record additional revenue from the next quarter, creating a perpetual cycle of inflated earnings.

# Nortel Networks (2007)

The Canadian telecommunications equipment manufacturer was found to have engaged in various accounting irregularities, including round-tripping. They manipulated revenue recognition by recording sales to distributors as final sales, even when the products were likely to be returned.

# Wirecard (2020)

While not exclusively a tech company, Wirecard was a major player in digital payment processing. The company was found to have engaged in massive fraud, including round-tripping transactions. They created fake customer accounts and used a network of partner companies to simulate legitimate business activities, inflating their reported revenues and cash balances.

These examples demonstrate that round-tripping has been a persistent issue in the tech sector, often used to artificially inflate revenues, manipulate stock prices, and deceive investors. The complex nature of technology businesses and their often intangible assets can make it easier to engage in such deceptive practices. However, increased regulatory scrutiny and improved auditing practices have made it more challenging for companies to engage in round-tripping without detection. 

# AI Labs Round Tripping

 

The practice of major tech companies providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting growth in datacenter and AI usage can indeed be viewed as a form of financial round-tripping. This strategy raises significant concerns about the authenticity of reported revenue growth, as it creates a cycle where investments return as revenue, inflating metrics without genuine market expansion.

# Artificial Inflation of Revenue

When tech giants invest in AI startups or provide them with datacenter credits, they essentially create a loop where their initial financial outlay returns to them as revenue. This cycle artificially inflates their cloud and AI service usage metrics, presenting an illusion of robust growth. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) have invested billions in AI firms like Anthropic, which then become major consumers of AWS's cloud services. This arrangement leads to an inflated perception of demand for these services, despite the fact that the growth is internally generated rather than stemming from new market participants.

# Lack of Economic Substance

These transactions often lack real economic substance because the AI labs are primarily spending money provided by the tech companies themselves. This means that instead of attracting new, independent customers or generating fresh revenue streams, the tech companies are simply cycling their own funds back into their revenue reports. Such practices can mislead stakeholders into believing that there is a substantial increase in market demand when, in reality, the growth is not driven by external factors.

# Misleading Market Perception

# Inflated Growth Figures

By reporting increased usage of their cloud and AI services due to these internal transactions, tech companies create a misleading picture of sector growth. This self-generated growth does not reflect broader market demand but rather a strategic manipulation to enhance financial statements. As highlighted by industry analysts, this practice can give an impression of thriving business activity that may not exist.

# Skewed Competition Metrics

This practice also distorts the competitive landscape by making it appear that certain companies are outperforming others in attracting AI business. In reality, these companies are subsidizing usage through investments and credits, which can skew competition metrics and obscure true market dynamics.

# Financial Interdependence

The symbiotic relationship created between tech giants and AI labs through these arrangements can lead to reduced innovation. AI labs may become overly reliant on specific cloud providers for resources, limiting their ability to explore diverse technological solutions. Additionally, this interdependence can result in conflicts of interest in the development and deployment of AI technologies, as the success of the startups becomes closely tied to the continued support from their benefactor companies.

# Regulatory and Accounting Concerns

# Revenue Recognition Issues

Questions arise regarding how these transactions should be accounted for. If a company invests in an AI startup and subsequently recognizes revenue from that startup's usage of its services, it creates a complex accounting situation that may not accurately reflect the company's true financial position. This ambiguity opens up potential for manipulation, as companies could use these arrangements to meet growth targets or analyst expectations.

# Potential for Manipulation

The practice opens the door for potential manipulation of financial statements. Companies might engage in these arrangements to artificially boost reported revenues, thereby meeting or exceeding market expectations without actual underlying business growth.

# Market Distortion

This practice can lead to a distorted view of the AI and cloud computing markets. By overestimating market size and growth rates based on inflated projections from round-tripping deals, resources may be misallocated. This could potentially create an AI bubble driven by circular investments rather than genuine demand. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while providing resources to AI labs can drive innovation, the current practice of offering datacenter credits and reporting resulting usage as growth shares similarities with financial round-tripping. It raises significant concerns about transparency, authenticity in corporate reporting, and potential distortions in market perceptions within the AI and cloud computing sectors.

# TLDR;

The practice of tech giants providing datacenter credits to AI labs and then reporting the resulting usage as growth is essentially a modern form of financial round-tripping. This deceptive cycle artificially inflates revenue and usage metrics, creating a false perception of market demand. It distorts the competitive landscape, potentially stifles innovation, and raises serious regulatory concerns. Most alarmingly, it could be fueling an AI bubble based on circular investments rather than genuine market growth. Investors and regulators should be wary of this practice, as it may be masking the true state of the AI and cloud computing markets, potentially leading to misallocation of resources and inflated valuations in the tech sector.",0,33,1726845160.0

FedEx Slumps as Lowered Outlook Offers Economic Warning Sign,"> (Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. tumbled the most in two years after warning that its business would slow in the year ahead, an ominous sign about the direction of the US economy.

> The parcel giant was hurt by a pullback on priority services as customers traded down to cheaper shipping options in what Chief Executive Officer Raj Subramaniam called “a challenging quarter.” A broad effort to slash costs gained traction but only partially blunted those headwinds, the Memphis-based company said late Thursday.

> FedEx’s shares slid 14% after the markets opened Friday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since September 2022. Rival United Parcel Service Inc. fell 3.4%.

> The results spooked investors looking for signals about where the economy is headed after the Federal Reserve this week cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020. The policy shift reflects growing concern about the health of the labor market as job gains have slowed and inflation cools.

ILA Union Strike: Potential Economic Impacts,"As many of you might have heard, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) will be on strike October 1st, and it's crucial to discuss what this could mean for our economy.

# What’s Happening?

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: The ILA plays a vital role in moving goods in and out of ports. A prolonged strike could lead to significant delays in shipments, affecting everything from retail to manufacturing.
2. **Rising Prices**: With supply chains strained, we could see increased prices on everyday goods. Retailers may pass on shipping costs to consumers, which could contribute to inflation.
3. **Impact on Jobs**: While the strike focuses on union members, it could also affect ancillary businesses—like transportation and warehousing—leading to job losses or reduced hours for many.
4. **Long-Term Industry Changes**: Depending on the strike's duration, companies might seek alternative shipping methods or routes, which could reshape industry standards and lead to lasting changes in how goods are transported.
5. **Investor Confidence**: Ongoing labor disputes can create uncertainty in the market. Investors might pull back, leading to volatility that could affect stock prices and economic growth.",0,3,1726841641.0

Three Stock sectors that are the direct beneficiaries of the interest rate cut.,"* Changes in the interest rate usually impact the stock market immediately and its effect on the economy may take about a year.
* A drop in interest rate tends to lift the stock market but is not equal across the board.
* The Fed believes GDP growth remains solid with the labor market appearing healthy and inflation trending back to 2%.
* The Summary of economic projections (SEP) points to another 50 basis points of cuts in 2024, and another 100 basis points in 2025.
* FOMC believes interest rates will stabilize in 2026.

There are going to be much more interest rate cuts at least to the end of 2025 and here are the three sectors that would benefit the most from the multiple rate cuts:

1. **Financial sector** --> Banks' lending and refinancing activities ramp up with the falling interest rates.  Banks, insurance companies, and mortgage lenders also benefit from borrowing more money at lower rates.  The lending default rate significantly drops with cheaper refinancing and an improving economy.
2. **Technology sector** --> Technology stock valuations are heavily dependent on their future earnings which directly benefit from decreasing interest rates.  A lower borrowing cost is critical to the growth of tech companies.
3. **Real Estate sector** --> Mortgages become more affordable which would lead to a rise in demand for properties, and increase profitability of real estate investments.",26,20,1726833869.0
A Three Mile Island nuclear reactor could restart under a new deal with Microsoft,"https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/three-mile-island-microsoft-constellation-proposal-20240920.html

Five years after a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in central Pennsylvania closed amid financial troubles, its owner wants to bring it back online.

Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Corp. said Friday that it has signed a 20-year agreement with Microsoft under which the technology company will purchase power from Three Mile Island Unit 1. That reactor is located at an independent facility from Unit 2, which closed in 1979 after experiencing a partial meltdown

Constellation said it would spend $1.6 billion to restart Unit 1 — and won’t seek any public subsidies — which the company said “operated at industry-leading levels of safety and reliability for decades.” Federal regulators would need to approve a restart, though it already has support from Gov. Josh Shapiro. The company said it expects the reactor to come online by 2028.

“I think policymakers have recognized that a strategy that is dependent just on wind, solar, batteries isn’t going to fully get us there and meet the needs of the system from a reliability standpoint,” Joe Dominguez, Constellation’s president and CEO, said in an interview.

For Microsoft, buying energy from the renewed plant, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, will “help match the power its data centers in PJM use with carbon-free energy,” according to a news release. Valley Forge-based PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization, operates the electric grid in 13 states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Exelon Generation pulled the plug on 837-megawatt Unit 1 in 2019 after state lawmakers declined to support legislation that would have directed hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies from Pennsylvania electric customers to the state’s nuclear industry. Exelon at the time said it couldn’t compete in markets dominated by low-cost natural gas. Constellation’s predecessor company split from Exelon in 2022.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Would there be anything wrong with buying short ETFs and attaching tight trailing stop losses to them?,"So I have been keeping track of the VIX and how it moves. When it goes well below the 50 day moving average I begin to invest in SQQQ and SDOW. I buy them usually on an afternoon then the next morning attach sell trailing stop loss orders of 0.4%, 0.8% and then 1.2%. These are not just short ETFs but they are leveraged. They move quick at times and when we have red days they make me a lot of money. Most of the movement with these happens during non-trading hours. 

I about 30% of the time guess wrong and those trailing stop sell orders come in handy then. I'm not aware of any brokerages that allow these short ETFs to be traded during non-trading hours (if anyone knows of any let me know bc that would be a game changer). 

Is there otherwise anything wrong with this? Why doesn't everyone all the time do exactly this? This has made me a lot of money and the more I think of it maybe the smart thing to do is buy up the long (leveraged) ETFs like TQQQ and UDOW and attach the 0.4% etc sell trailing stop loss orders. When we have a really positive day like today (Sept. 19, 2024) sure your SQQQ and SDOW will sell off immediately but you will offset those losses and still make bank on the TQQQ and UDOW.

Mercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook

Stuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.

This was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.

Additionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.

Therefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:

Mercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.
Mercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.
Mercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).
Free cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).

# Historical Context

In 2021, PureCycle faced significant challenges:

* Short-seller reports from highly credible sources such as Hindenburg Research questioned the company's technology and financial projections.
* Concerns were raised about the scalability of their recycling process.
* The company faced regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.

These issues led to volatility in PureCycle's stock price and raised doubts about the company's future.

# Recent Developments

Despite past challenges, PureCycle's latest updates indicate advancements:

1. **Operational Progress**: The Ironton, Ohio facility reportedly achieved:
   * Feed rates exceeding 10,000 pounds per hour
   * Processing over 200,000 pounds of feedstock in a single day
   * Over 1 million pounds processed in a seven-day span
2. **Technological Improvements**: Successfully installed and commissioned modifications to the co-product removal system.
3. **Transition to Commercial Operations**:
   * Compounded approximately 1,500,000 pounds to date
   * Plans for increased production and sales in Q4 2024
4. **Financial Backing**: Secured $90 million in new financing, suggesting ongoing interest in protecting the equity of current shareholders leading the largest shareholder to double down with 8million more shares last week.

# Addressing Past Concerns

While these developments don't definitively resolve all previous criticisms, they potentially address some key points:

1. **Scalability**: The reported production volumes suggest progress in scaling up operations.
2. **Technology Viability**: Continuous operation and product output indicate the core technology is functional.
3. **Market Interest**: Planned sales and investor backing point to potential market demand.

# Looking Ahead

PureCycle's journey illustrates the challenges of bringing new recycling technologies to market.

The **game-changing polypropylene recycling** technology that PureCycle uses consists of seven main process stages that help close the loop on plastic waste while making recycled plastics more accessible at scale.

PureCycle Technologies claims to have developed a novel approach to recycling polypropylene (PP), one of the most widely used plastics. Here's an overview of how their technology differs from traditional recycling methods:

# Traditional PP Recycling Challenges

1. **Color and Odor**: Conventional recycling often results in grayish, odorous plastics.
2. **Contamination**: Additives and impurities are difficult to remove completely.
3. **Quality**: Recycled PP typically has inferior properties compared to virgin plastic.
4. **Limited Applications**: Due to quality issues, recycled PP has limited use cases.

# PureCycle's Innovative Approach

PureCycle's technology aims to address these challenges through a proprietary purification process:

1. **Solvent-based Purification**:
   * Uses a non-toxic solvent to dissolve and purify polypropylene.
   * Claimed to remove colors, odors, and contaminants more effectively than mechanical recycling.
2. **Preservation of Polymer Structure**:
   * The process reportedly maintains the molecular structure of PP.
   * This could result in recycled plastic with properties similar to virgin material.
3. **Broader Feedstock Acceptance**:
   * Can potentially process a wider range of PP waste, including low-quality or contaminated sources.
4. **Ultra-Pure Output**:
   * The end product is said to be colorless, odorless, and free from most contaminants.
   * This could allow for use in food-grade and medical applications.
5. **Energy Efficiency**:
   * The process is claimed to be more energy-efficient than producing virgin PP.

# Key Differentiators

1. **Quality of Output**: PureCycle claims its recycled PP is virtually indistinguishable from virgin plastic.
2. **Scalability**: The technology is designed for large-scale, continuous operation.
3. **Circular Economy Potential**: By producing high-quality recycled PP, it could enable true closed-loop recycling for this material.

# Potential Impact

If successful at scale, PureCycle's technology could:

* Increase the value and demand for recycled PP
* Reduce dependency on virgin plastic production
* Enable new applications for recycled plastics in sensitive industries

# Challenges and Considerations

* The technology is still scaling up, and long-term performance is yet to be fully demonstrated.
* Economic viability at large scale needs to be proven.

"Walmart Plans Instant Bank Payments, Cutting Out Card Networks","[Full Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/walmart-plans-instant-bank-payments-cutting-out-card-networks?srnd=phx-economics-v2)

Walmart Inc. customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing.

The world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.

The consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart.

In the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs. However, frustration has mounted among merchants over fees they pay for card processing to banks and networks like Visa and Mastercard.

## The Threat of Chinese Exports to US/Europe

Meanwhile, China is the new auto giant. [This graph of exports by country is from early 2024](https://i.imgur.com/nPAd2wh.jpeg)--China is the Japan of the 1980s. The threat of Chinese competition is so high that EU is considering 50% tariffs (currently 15% on Chinese EVs), while the US is at 100%. In past years, I've always heard that Chinese cars are junk. Junk cars wouldn't need to need to have their price doubled to keep consumers from buying them. In other countries, Chinese brands are taking over the nascent EV market: ""Chinese automakers accounted for 88% of the EV market in Brazil and 70% in Thailand in the first quarter of this year.""

In Europe, despite tariffs: ""Chinese carmakers' share of passenger car sales in Europe rose to 17% in the first seven months of 2024 from 12% a year earlier, according to data from automotive consultancy Inovev, and Chinese car exports have reached record highs this year.""

> Foreign brands’ market share of Chinese auto sales is tracking at a record low of 37 per cent in the first seven months of 2024, down from 64 per cent in 2020, according to data from Automobility, a Shanghai consultancy. So far this year, US brands are down more than 23 per cent while Japanese, Korean and German carmakers have also suffered double-digit declines, the data showed. By contrast, sales of Chinese brands are up nearly 22 per cent with Chinese companies overwhelmingly dominating sales of the EV market.

## Technological Edge in EVs for China?

[Nearly 40% of Chinese auto sales are of EVs](https://i.imgur.com/cqX6jts.png) versus 10% for the US and 21% for Europe. Aren't the US/EU supposed to be championing the green revolution in autos? BYD had a 5% share of Chinese cars in 2022--today it's 20%.  That's a big threat to Tesla for instance, who gets 20% of its revenue from China.

## Possible Bull Case

So  is there a bull case for VW? Here is a [Sum of the Parts](https://x.com/StanphylCap/status/1832096596319727717) bull case for Volkswagen. VW owns stakes in Porche, Traton in addition to owning Audi, VW cars, Skoda, Seat, Cupra Lamborghini, Bentley and Ducati. I don't fully understand how the debt impacts the analysis here, though. OP claims the debt is held by a captive finance arm and fully secured by leased cars + non-recourse (only collateral can be pursued, nothing more).

## Closing Thoughts

How are European automakers going to handle the competitive threat of a new Chinese auto juggernaut along with massive fiscal support in the US (from the IRA)? Their energy prices face much higher spikes [than in the US and China](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliasferrerbreda/2023/09/21/energy-europes-big-disadvantage/). Labor unions are much more powerful in Europe, making cost cuts difficult. Autos are already a very difficult sector to invest in, but I suspect European cars brands may be uninvestible and they are rightfully cheap on a P/E basis (if earnings are even positive).

I am super confused at to what the soft landing entails,"So the basic job of Fed is to maintain steady employment and 2% inflation target, and how they do this is by maintaining required interest rate. This part I get 100%

in past every time there is a sudden rate cuts, it means they are panicking and underlying market conditions are not looking good. Rise in unemployment, either we are into or going towards recession. However, this time there is 0.5% rate cut this week, and already hinted for another 0.5% rate cut by end the year. Thats almost 1% full rate cut in a quarte seems unprecedented if we are not in recession.

So since market is reacting so positively, we are officially saying that we have a balanced unemployment and inflation to support unprecedented rate cut meaning ""Soft landing""? Because if not then we are in Recession = ""Hard landing"".

Just want to understand these are the only two scenarios or something else as well?",71,97,1726751628.0

*One argument for cutting rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, instead of 50 basis points goes like this: The Federal Reserve only makes larger cuts when something is going wrong in the economy or financial system.*  
  
*And that’s partly true, but it also misses an important point.*  
  
*Since the Fed began to publicize interest-rate changes in 1994, the central bank has moved from a neutral stance to a cutting stance six times.*  
  
*The Fed initiated shallow cutting cycles in 1995, 1998, and 2019, each time leading off with a cut of 25 basis points.*  
  
*The Fed began what would be deeper cutting cycles three times, in early 2001, 2007, and when the Covid-19 pandemic began to spread in March 2020, each time leading with a cut of 50 basis points.*  
  
*This has led many analysts to conclude that larger cuts of 50 basis points are “reserved” for more severe situations, and there is some truth to this pattern.*  
  
*Stock markets were sliding as the tech bubble began to deflate with the Fed cut rates in January 2001 by 50 basis points. The bursting of a subprime mortgage-credit bubble in August 2007 preceded the Fed’s cut of the same magnitude in September 2007.*  
  
*At the same time, Fed officials at both of those meetings still thought their more aggressive action might preempt a downturn, according to the transcripts of those meetings. In other words, just because 50-basis-point cuts look, in retrospect, like actions reserved for the start of a recession, officials didn’t think that way in real time.*",77,72,1726743649.0

YouTube announces AI features from Google DeepMind for Shorts creators ,"YouTube on Wednesday announced artificial-intelligence features for creators on its Shorts platform that tap into Google’s DeepMind video-generation model.

The features, known as Veo, will allow creators to add AI-generated backgrounds to their videos as well as use written prompts to generate standalone, six-second video clips. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said he hopes Veo will enable creators to produce more Shorts videos with the help of AI.

“Everything that we showed with AI was meant to really enhance the work that you do, make it faster, more efficient, to bring your creative ideas to life faster,” said Mohan, speaking at the Made on YouTube event in New York.

The Veo AI backgrounds are an upgrade over a similar AI-generation feature announced by YouTube in 2023 called Dream Screen. The company said its Veo AI background feature will roll out later this year while the six-second AI clips will become available in 2025.

Other announcements at the event included new features in the YouTube Studio app that will allow creators to use AI to generate titles, thumbnails and video ideas. Those features will roll out in late 2024, YouTube said.

Creators have been exploring various ways to leverage generative AI technology. Creators have used the new technology to insert clips in their videos or produce entirely AI-generated videos.

However, some creators expressed concerns that their videos on YouTube are used to train the AI models that built Veo.

“I don’t know how I feel about all this AI stuff,” said Thomas Simons, a comedian with more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube. “It doesn’t fill me with confidence and love.”

There has been criticism that other services like Facebook have become overrun by spammy, AI-generated content. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate intellectual property protections.

YouTube’s AI-generated content will be watermarked and will have a label indicating it was created by AI, the company said.

Generative AI places a new perspective on the creator economy, giving creators free access to tools utilized by large language models.

We “really sit at the nexus of that technology and creativity,” Mohan said. “Putting those two things together gives us this unique lens that everything we build is really about enhancing that human creativity.”

*Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*  
  
*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*  
  
*In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*  
  
*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*  
  
*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Michelle W.

If the Fed delivers a 50 basis point cut, it could trigger a surge of optimism and a major rally in the stock market.  
  
Here's why I believe we could see a 300-point jump today:  
  
Boosting Investor Confidence: A deeper rate cut would signal that the Fed is committed to propping up the economy amid ongoing uncertainties. This would inject a lot of confidence into both institutional and retail investors, who are eager for signs that the Fed is taking bold action.

  
Cheaper Borrowing Costs: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper for companies, encouraging business investments and spending. Investors often see this as a precursor to growth, further pushing stocks higher.  
Easing Recession Fears: There’s been growing concern about a potential economic slowdown, and a significant cut would help ease those fears, signaling that the Fed is proactive. This could drive capital back into the market, particularly in sectors that have been lagging due to recession worries.

  
Market Sentiment: Historically, aggressive rate cuts have resulted in strong short-term market reactions. With a 50 basis point cut, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all post substantial gains by the end of the day.

  
It’s important to remember that nothing is guaranteed, but if the Fed comes through with this aggressive move, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the market finish 300 points higher, if not more. What do you think? Could this spark the rally we’ve been waiting for, or is the market too unpredictable to call?

Boeing starts furloughing 'large number' of employees as strike continues,"Boeing will furlough a “large number” of U.S. executives, managers and other staff, citing the ongoing machinist strike as the company races to preserve cash, CEO Kelly Ortberg told employees on Wednesday.

The furloughs will affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, a company spokesperson said.

The plan came less than a week after Boeing’s more than 30,000 machinists in the Seattle area and Oregon voted down a new labor contract and 96% voted to strike, walking off the job just after midnight on Friday.

Ortberg said affected employees would take one week of furlough every four weeks for the strike’s duration and he and his team would take “commensurate” pay cuts for the duration of the strike.

“While this is a tough decision that impacts everybody, it is in an effort to preserve our long-term future and help us navigate through this very difficult time. We will continue to transparently communicate as this dynamic situation evolves and do all we can to limit this hardship,” Ortberg said in his message.

Boeing’s CFO Brian West earlier this week said the company would freeze hiring and raises to cut costs, and would let “non-essential contractors” go temporarily.

ROIC investing strategy.,"View the graphs and diagrams here: [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/2qiEkrh)

I created a python program that simulates buying the stocks with the highest ROIC among the 250 first stocks of the sp500 when sorted in alphabetical order (not ticker) from 2010 to 2023. First 250 from this list: [List of S&P 500 companies - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies). Only the 250 first stocks to reduce API costs. I used the FMP api.

It buys and sells the stocks at the start of every year, and buys an equal $ value amount of each stock, without taking stock price into consideration. Like for example buying 1.5 of a stock or 0.67 of a stock to make sure all the stocks are weighted equally.

Neither dividends nor transaction cost taken into consideration.

Results:

Overall Return of the Strategy: 1222.37%

CAGR: 21%

Overall Return of the S&P 500: 320.99%

Sharpe Ratio of the Strategy: 0.94

Standard Deviation of Excess Returns: 0.00923

T-test Results:

t-statistic = 1.2348

p-value = 0.2169

With a p-value of 0.2169 its not a statistically significant strategy when using the standard significance level of 5%. The sharpe-ratio 0.94 also tells us that it has a higher risk/reward ratio compared to the s&p500 with a sharpe of 1.06. However i still find it to be an interesting dicovery, and i believe other people will as well.

Any thoughts?

Google wins court challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine over ad product ,"The European Union’s second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.

The case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.

Google acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.

But the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.

The commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU’s General Court.

The General Court said Wednesday that it “upholds the majority of the findings” but “annuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of” nearly 1.5 billion euros.

The court added that the commission “failed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses” that it had deemed abusive.

A Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.

“This case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers’ websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission’s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,” the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.

The commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court.

There has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.

This month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case.

Wash sale rule Explanation- Am I understanding this right?,"I made a lot of trades in 2024, I was up 50k at one point and then gave back almost all the profit and I am only up around 4k currently for 2024. I am assuming I only have to pay capital gains taxes on 4k profit for the year, not 50k or some figure more than my overall gains of 4k because of wash sale rule. I did lot of day trading and buying same stock within 30 days of selling and I wanted to understand the implications of wash sale rule. I currently have sold all my positions and do not hold any stock/options and I am up 4k on the year.

Example 1: I bought NVDA calls on August 14, sold on August 15 for gains of 5k. Then I bought NVDA calls on August 20 and sold on August 25 for loss of 3k. I did this several times with NVDA stock and options and have profit of 20k from NVDA and loss of 19k with overall net gain of around 1k on NVDA. I am trying to understand wash sale rule and my understanding is I only have to pay capital gains taxes for 1k on NVDA. My cost basis on my second purchase gets adjusted from profit on first purchase and my cost basis for third purchase gets adjusted based on profit/loss from second sell and so on for future purchase. Is this correct statement? Also, I currently do not hold any NVDA stocks or options, I sold them all.

Example 2: I did same thing with AMZN stock too. I bought calls, sold for some loss, bought more calls within 30 days and sold for some profit and rinse and repeat. I did this multiple times throughout the year.

I traded mostly tech stocks and at one point was in profit in excess of 50k. However I did not sell at the top and the stocks came crashing down and I lost all my profit. At one point I lost all profit and was 20k down on my cost basis too. I was able to recover my loss and I am up 4k in the year. I am now thinking about my Uncle sam and how much does he want for 2024. With no current positions in any stock/options currently, my thinking is just taxes on 4k profit. Let me know if I am wrong or if there is something that I am overlooking and if I need to put more money away for my taxes.",0,15,1726670087.0
"Received $85,000 recently. Should we put it in an ETF such as S&P500 right now or wait?","Hi Everyone 
I received around $85,000 recently as a back payment for a long term consultancy assignment I was working. Instead of spending it, I was thinking of saving it on the side for the future. Now the question - should I put the amount in an ETF right now such as S&P 500. I’m skeptical of the stock market these days considering it’s already overvalued and the risk of an impending recession but then I also get a FOMO. The second option I’ve been thinking about is putting the entire money in either bonds or t-bills for a safe return without risk. 

Your advice, albeit I understand non financial, would be greatly appreciated. ",378,417,1726667640.0

# [Stock futures rise slightly as traders debate how big the Fed’s anticipated rate cut will be: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Wednesday as Wall Street anticipated the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in four years. Gains were muted as uncertainty lingered over how big the easing will be from the central bank.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 36 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.2% each.
*****
> The Fed is expected to deliver its latest policy decision at 2 p.m. ET. The central bank is expected to lower rates by at least a quarter percentage point, but traders are divided over how big the reduction will be. CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows traders pricing in a 65% chance of a half-point cut and 35% odds of a quarter-point move.
*****
> It’s unusual to have this much uncertainty into a Fed decision as the central bank typically tries to telegraph its next move to the markets. Traders had believed for most of the last month that the Fed would lower by a quarter point, but the idea of a super-sized cut began to gain traction in the past week.
*****
> “You’d have to go back over 15 years to find such an uncertain situation this close to the decision. A lot of money will be made and lost today,” Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank head of global economics and thematic research, wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
> The ushering in of a cutting cycle is expected to shore up a stalling economy and further boost an already strong market, with the S&P 500 at a record following an 18% gain this year. The benchmark has averaged gains of about 16% in the 12 months following the first cut, according to data from Canaccord Genuity.
*****
> Despite these market expectations, some investors remain cautious about cutting rates too much, too soon. Peter Cecchini, Axonic Capital’s director of research, called a 50 basis point cut “unusual” as the first move in a cutting cycle from the Fed given the current state of the housing market.
*****
> “This is not really the environment where I think the Fed needs to do a 50 basis point cut as a preemptive measure, when historically it’s never done so,” he told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Tuesday.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed session that saw the S&P 500 edge up 0.03% after notching another all-time high during intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 16 points, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.

BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)

BlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  

The financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. 

The investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. 

Dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

The fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement. Larry Fink: ‘Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity’ © Bloomberg 

The soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  

“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. 

MGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. 

In 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. 

The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content 

“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. 

In the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. 

“There is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chief executive, said in a statement.",428,91,1726613876.0
NASA Awards LUNR Near Space Network Contract - Potential Value of $4.82 Billion,"""Intuitive Machines (Nasdaq: LUNR) has been awarded a Near Space Network (NSN) contract by NASA for communication and navigation services in the near space region.

Good books on market cycles?,"I'm curious what books people here have enjoyed reading about the cyclical nature of the stock market. It's becoming somewhat noticeable to me that the stock market seems to have a multi-year cyclical nature in confluence with global liquidity cycles, interest rate cycles, and other potential cycles that I think might relate but don't know enough to say they do (real estate, elections, etc). I'm not educated enough to necessarily claim that there ARE indeed cycles for these things .. but it seems like there might be.

(DD) Limoneira - LMNR - Citrus fruits and Real Estate. Two things that will continue to go up in price.,"Alright, listen up—**Limoneira Co. (LMNR)** is more than just another agribusiness. This company is strategically positioned in multiple growth sectors with a solid balance of core revenue and serious upside potential. Let’s get into the technicals:

# Company Snapshot

* **Ticker**: LMNR
* **Sector**: Agribusiness, Real Estate Development, Renewable Energy
* **Core Focus**: Limoneira is one of the largest producers of lemons in the U.S. and globally. On top of that, they’ve diversified into real estate development and solar energy, creating multiple revenue streams.
* **Market Cap**: \~$450-500 million (a small-cap with room to run)
* **Founded**: 1893 (These guys aren’t new to the game, and their longevity speaks to strong fundamentals)

# Strategic Advantages

# A. Dominant Player in Citrus Production

* **Lemons & Avocados**: Limoneira owns about over 12,000 acres of farmland across California, Arizona, and Chile. That’s huge. They’re a major supplier of lemons, with a foothold in high-margin markets. They're essentially what replaced the Florida citrus industry. The global demand for citrus—especially lemons—is growing due to health trends, and Limoneira is well-positioned to capitalize.
* **Vertical Integration**: The company controls its supply chain—farming, packing, and marketing—which maximizes margins and improves operational efficiency. Limoneira isn’t just a grower; they manage their product from farm to table, cutting down on costs and giving them more control over pricing.
* **HLB Disease Wiping out Competition**: Buckle up, this point is going to be a bit controversial. HLB (Huanglongbing) is a disease that was responsible for the collapse of the Florida citrus industry and is actively killing citrus farms worldwide. Limoneira remains unaffected by HLB to this day, and appears to be at the forefront of HLB prevention. They're ahead of the curve and has had the luxury of time to develop various methods to secure HLB prevention. This means that citrus supply is decreasing worldwide while Limoneira is one of the very few companies that can meet growing demands. Citrus products get pricier, Limoneira makes more profit.

# B. Real Estate as a Long-Term Growth Catalyst

* **Harvest at Limoneira**: This is where the big money’s going to come from. They’re developing a 1,500-home community on prime California real estate. Over time, this project is expected to generate significant cash flow and push earnings higher. If you like steady long-term gains, real estate adds a substantial value to their portfolio.
* **Land Appreciation**: Limoneira’s holding tons of land across high-demand regions. As real estate prices keep climbing in California and Arizona, this land is an undervalued asset sitting on their balance sheet. That’s baked-in value that hasn’t fully been realized yet by the market.

C. **Sustainability and Renewable Energy**

* **Solar Energy Investments**: Limoneira has made strategic investments in solar power, reducing their energy costs and boosting their environmental profile. In an age where ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters more than ever, Limoneira’s ahead of the curve.
* **Water Conservation**: Given California’s ongoing water challenges, Limoneira’s focus on water efficiency adds a key operational edge. Their ability to sustain production through efficient water use is crucial in maintaining stable margins and addressing regulatory concerns.

# Financial Performance

# A. Revenue Growth and Stability

* **Consistent Cash Flow**: Despite the cyclical nature of agriculture, Limoneira has maintained steady revenue. Their diversified operations—agriculture, real estate, renewable energy—create a solid foundation for consistent cash flow. Citrus production alone has shown strong demand resilience, with premium pricing power in high-end markets.

# B. Real Estate Boost to Earnings

* **Massive Upside from Harvest Project**: Harvest at Limoneira is expected to deliver serious returns. While the agricultural side of the business keeps things stable, this real estate project could drive significant EPS growth over the next few years as homes are built and sold. We’re talking hundreds of millions in potential revenue over the life of the project.

# C. Balance Sheet

* **Land Holdings**: Their real estate holdings are a huge hidden asset. The market hasn’t fully priced in the long-term value of these assets. This land is strategically located in high-demand areas—prime for development as housing demand grows in California.
* **Low Debt Levels**: Limoneira has maintained manageable debt, which is crucial for a company balancing real estate projects and agribusiness. Their debt load is aligned with their growth strategy, and they’ve got the flexibility to expand without straining their balance sheet.

# Growth Catalysts

# A. Global Citrus Demand

* **Rising Consumption**: The global demand for citrus, particularly lemons, is growing due to increasing health consciousness and their use in beverages, food, and cosmetics. Limoneira’s strong export presence gives them international growth potential, particularly in emerging markets like Asia, where demand is expanding rapidly.

# B. Real Estate Development

* **Ongoing Project Phases**: As they continue to develop Harvest at Limoneira, you’ll start seeing big one-time revenue bumps when properties are sold. And remember, this isn’t just a one-and-done project—there’s room for expansion and more developments once this is complete.

# C. Sustainability Trends

* **ESG Investing**: More institutional investors are pouring capital into companies with strong ESG profiles, and Limoneira’s solar energy investments and sustainable farming practices make them a prime candidate. This could lead to increased demand for their stock as more ESG funds look to invest in companies like Limoneira.

# Valuation Metrics

* **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**: Limoneira’s P/B ratio is currently sitting at a point that suggests its assets—especially their real estate holdings—are undervalued. As the market begins to fully realize the potential of their land and real estate projects, we could see significant multiple expansion.
* **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Their current P/E might seem high for an agribusiness, but remember—this isn’t just an agriculture play. As real estate revenues kick in, that P/E is likely to drop significantly, boosting the stock price.

# Risks (Bear Case)

# A. Agricultural Volatility

* **Weather Dependency**: Agriculture always has risks related to weather—drought, storms, etc. But Limoneira mitigates this with geographically diverse farmland, spreading their risk across multiple regions and climates.
* **Labor Costs**: California’s rising labor costs could pressure margins, but Limoneira’s diversified revenue streams and operational efficiencies help cushion against this. 
* **Immigration Policy:** Relating to labor costs, the company does appear to rely on cheap labor supply, which are largely migrant workers. Any immigration policy that greatly impacts the ability for migrants to work in the farming industry would mean Limoneira would take a hit in terms of costs. They largely have automated the packing process, but harvest automation is still in the works and likely will not be viable in the near future.
* **HLB:** The possibility of this disease hitting Limoneira's farms are definitely not zero, this is partially why they're diversifying their cash flow with avocados, energy, and real estate.

# B. Real Estate Market Fluctuations

* **California Market Risks**: While housing demand is strong, any downturn in the California real estate market could delay profits from the Harvest project. That said, they’re in regions with steady demand, so a major downturn seems unlikely in the near future.

# Conclusion

* **Diversified Revenue Streams**: Limoneira’s balanced mix of high-demand agriculture (lemons, avocados), long-term real estate development, and sustainability initiatives makes them a versatile play. You’ve got both short-term and long-term growth potential here.
* **Undervalued Real Estate**: The real estate projects aren’t fully priced into the stock right now. When those revenues start hitting, the upside potential could be substantial. Limoneira’s land holdings are a massive asset that’s flying under the radar for many investors.
* **Sustainability Focus**: ESG-focused investing is growing, and Limoneira’s renewable energy initiatives and water conservation efforts make them an attractive target for those big ESG funds looking for solid companies in agriculture and real estate.

How would you value Coinbase?,"For starters, I think the difference in price and value with Coinbase stock is huge. I keep seeing it mentioned as 'cheap' because of the 30x P/E ratio. But that is way off.

Here are a few key metrics showing conflicting signals:

1. The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.
2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.

I know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.

$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive. But they have somehow combined 3-4 very valuable business models: a financial exchange, custody assets, software products and asset management.

I don't care for the typical valuation methods. Not even comparables are applicable here. Only ICE, Nasdaq, CBOE and CMOE are similar but each has a different specialty. Even sum-of-parts would be interesting but would require constant updates. Which is useless because crypto momentum and volatility have a life of their own.

Tell me how you would value this stock. What would you need to see to de-risk this as an investment?

P.S. Coinbase has been on my radar because of the recent regulatory progress. Their legal team is crushing it. First, they're spending \~$20m YTD to provide more clarity for investors. Second, this will secure their leadership position along with some regulatory capture. It's a winning position from my perspective. But entry point still matters.",59,100,1726596560.0

"Canada's inflation cools to 2% in Aug, reaches central bank's target","Referencing to Canada's case, inflation target has been reached with only 75bps interest rate cuts ...

What action will be taken by Fed in September? 25bps or 50bps?

Furthermore, is it realistic to continue pricing in 100bps to 125bps interest rate cuts until end of 2024?

**Canada's inflation cools to 2% in Aug, reaches central bank's target**

&#x200B;

*Summary*

* *Core price measures eases to a 40-month low in Aug*
* *Consumer prices deflate in Aug on a monthly basis*
* *Rents rise by 8.9% in Aug from 8.5% in July*

&#x200B;

*Canada's annual inflation rate reached the central bank's target in August at it cooled to 2%, its lowest level since February 2021, data showed on Tuesday.*

*The closely watched core price measures also cooled to their lowest level in 40 months while month-on-month consumer prices deflated by 0.2%, Statistics Canada said.*

*Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the consumer price index (CPI) to cool to 2.1% from 2.5% in July on an annual basis, and expected it to be unchanged on a monthly basis.*

*The easing of price pressures was primarily helped by a drop in prices of gasoline, telephone services and clothing and footwear, while shelter costs - mortgage and rents - continued to cool at a tepid pace as rents continued their relentless rise.*

*At the Bank of Canada's monetary policy decision announcement earlier this month Governor Tiff Macklem had said the bank has to increasingly guard against the risk that inflation could fall below its target as economic growth was weak.*

*The BoC has reduced its key policy rate three times in a row from June, cutting by a cumulative 75 basis point to 4.25%.*

*Money markets are fully pricing in 25 basis point rate cuts twice in as many monetary policy meetings remaining in the year, but economists say that chances of a jumbo 50 basis point cut this year is gradually building up.*

*The BoC had predicted annual inflation to be at 2.6% this year and fall to 2.4% next year before coming down to its mid-point of the target range of 1-3% in 2026.*

*CPI-median - or the price change located in the middle of the CPI basket - slowed to 2.3% in August from 2.4% in July annually. CPI-trim - which excludes the most and the least volatile price items - cooled to 2.4% from 2.7%.*

*Gasoline prices, which contributed the most to the fall in inflation, fell by 5.1% and clothing and footwear fell by 4.4%.*

*Shelter costs, which accounts for close to 30% of the CPI basket, rose by 5.2% in August, from 5.7% in July, primarily led by rents which rose by 8.9% from 8.5% in July.*",188,61,1726577251.0
(9/17) - Tuesday's Pre-Market News & Stock Movers,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, September the 17th, 2024-

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street awaits retail sales data, Fed policy meeting: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street readied for key retail sales data and the start of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.4%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.6%. Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 131 points, or 0.3%.
*****
> Microsoft rose 2% after the tech giant hiked its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to 83 cents per share. The company also approved a $60 billion buyback program.
*****
> Intel shares popped about 7% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to make its foundry business a subsidiary. The Biden administration also awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding through the Chips Act.
*****
> Investors on Tuesday will parse retail sales data for August for one final glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer ahead of the Fed rate decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones are bracing for a 0.2% decline. Excluding autos, they see a 0.2% gain. The results could affect the rate cut outcome.
*****
> Wall Street is on standby for the Fed’s long-anticipated rate cut, a move that could help boost earnings growth for companies following a backdrop of steep borrowing costs and high inflation. The Fed first embarked on its aggressive hiking campaign in March 2022.
*****
> While Wall Street expects a cut Wednesday, the market is divided on the size of the potential reduction. Traders are currently pricing in a 67% chance that the central bank eases rates by 50 basis points, according to CME Group’s Fed Watch tool. That’s up from a roughly 47% chance Friday.
*****
> “Market expectations are split between a 25 basis point and a 50 basis point rate cut, as the decision is complicated by conflicting signals of solid economic activity but a weakening labor market,” said Principal Asset Management’s Seema Shah. “Rarely have market expectations been so torn, so close to a [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”
*****
> While a 50 basis point cut isn’t out of the question, the chief global strategist thinks that the Fed should take a more cautious approach to cutting and ease rates by 25 basis points. She is forecasting additional 25 basis point cuts in November and December.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a mixed trading session. The 30-stock Dow rose more than 228 points, or 0.55%, to close at a record high, while the S&P 500 added 0.13%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.52% as Apple and prominent chip stocks declined.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Can you be profitable solely by technical analysis?,"Im pretty new to stock trading, in fact, I just did my first deposit and I plan to slowly trade with it and make it grow, I have quite a lot of experience in Forex swing trading and I planned to do the same in stocks, I heard a lot of people just DCA when position goes against them and Im not sure if this is even a good idea (But to be fair it was one of my initial plans)
My initial idea was to find undervalued stocks (Ha, I don’t even know how to search for them) Purchase them when criteria aligns and DCA when criteria happens again if it kept going against me (which could mean waiting weeks or months for another entry) and add to positions in profit without adding any risk by protecting the new positions (In the same way you DCA and exit at breakeven when position recovers but in the opposite way…) The whole idea is not to just let losers run and cut the winners but also let the winners run and even add positions to them, to even a bit the balance…

I have some questions…

Just by technical analysis can you make profit on long term positions? If no, what usually people look appart ok “trusting” or “hoping” this specific company will perform better in the future?

is there any good material looking for long term investment strategies? Is it just better to invest in an index and forget?

How usually people find good stocks or undervalued stocks? Basically opportunities to buy? Just by reading forums / news? Any good training about that?

Any feedback appreciated and thanks for reading.

U.S. Awards Intel $3 Billion for Military Supply Program,"The Biden administration announced on Monday that it would award Intel up to $3 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing of advanced semiconductors for the U.S. military.

The program, called Secure Enclave, aims to create a trusted source of computer chips for the U.S. government. It will be funded out of a pool of money from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in an attempt to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign sources of semiconductors.

Much of the world’s semiconductors are currently made in Asia, particularly Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory, a position that Taiwan rejects, and American officials have long had concerns about the consequences for the U.S. economy and military if China were to invade Taiwan.

Intel officials said on Monday that the company would help “secure the domestic chip supply chain” and work with federal officials to “enhance the resilience of U.S. technological systems.”

The announcement comes about six months after the Biden administration awarded Intel a grant of up to $8.5 billion to help the company fund major construction projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. That money, along with the award announced Monday, stems from a $39 billion pot of CHIPS Act funding intended to encourage companies to build and expand semiconductor plants across the United States.

Federal officials also awarded Intel up to $11 billion in loans, and the company is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $100 billion over five years.

"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

Does it make sense to sell Put options if I want to create a position in a company?,"Let’s say I want to own 100 shares of X company trading at 100$ and I have to cash to purchase 100 shares at 100$.

Would it make sense to sell a naked put option with strike of 100$ expiring weekly.

Scenario I can think of:

1. Price goes above 100$ EOW
2. Price goes below 100$ EOW
3. Price stays 100$ EOW

Scenario 1.
Can have 2 situations 
1. Price goes above strike plus premium. 
2. Price goes above strike but less than premium 
In situation 1 I lose out on potential gains if I owned shares at 100$
In situation 2 I gain the premium plus strike minus current price of stock.
I will not own any shares EOW and I come out with profit!

Scenario 2.
2 situations
1. Price goes below strike minus premium 
2. Price goes below strike but not minus premium

In situation 1 I will get exercised and have cost basis of strike minus premium and fees right? And so I’ll be holding the shares like I want but from strike instead of market price. 
I come out at a loss here and shares EOW.

In situation 2 I will get exercised but my premium received will be greater than the loss I have per share from strike price. 
So I come out with a smaller profit than scenario 1 and shares EOW.

Scenario 3.
I make the premium and get exercised. Basically scenario 2 situation 2 right? Minus fees.

Am I missing anything important here?

I see 5 outcomes and only 1 outcome at a loss and 1 outcome with missed gains.

And since I already want to own shares I don’t really see being exercised as too bad unless the shares tanked so much in 1 week that changes my thesis on the company. 

Should one do this on a weekly basis and collect premium instead of buying the shares?",6,14,1726515734.0
FDA clears Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature for use. Here’s how it works,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday cleared Apple
’s new sleep apnea detection feature for use, which means it will come to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 later this month. 

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that causes a person’s breathing to repeatedly stop and start throughout the night. The condition affects more than 30 million people in the U.S., but only around 6 million are diagnosed, according to the American Medical Association. If it goes untreated, sleep apnea can cause fatigue and lead to more serious health issues like heart problems, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. 

“We are so excited about the incredible impact this feature can make for the millions of people living with undiagnosed sleep apnea,” Dr. Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said in the feature’s launch video.

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature marks the company’s latest attempt to position its wearables as a cheaper, simpler alternative to many existing health-care tests and devices. And the sleep disorder market could prove to be lucrative. 

To get evaluated for sleep apnea, for instance, patients typically participate in an at-home test or an in-lab test where they’re monitored overnight. Prices vary depending on insurance coverage, but the average in-lab test costs $3,000, according to a 2022 study in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. 

At-home tests are often less expensive, but they can still cost hundreds of dollars. The at-home sleep apnea test from Sleep Doctor costs $189, for example. Apple’s newest watch, the Series 10, starts at $399. 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature is “potentially a game changer” for patients who have been reluctant to seek out testing, said Dr. David Kuhlmann, a physician who has treated sleep disorders for nearly two decades in Missouri. Kuhlmann also serves on the board of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is a professional society for sleep medicine clinicians.  

Kuhlmann said the feature could be especially helpful for patients who sleep alone, and he thinks a lot of people will be surprised to find out they’re showing signs of sleep apnea.  

Even so, Kuhlmann said users should approach Apple’s sleep apnea data with some caution, as readings could be erroneous. He said it is unlikely that insurance companies will begin paying for sleep apnea therapies like CPAP machines based on Apple Watch data alone, which is why it is important for patients to follow up with their healthcare providers to get an official diagnosis. 

“People do need to be diagnosed in order to be treated,” Kuhlmann told CNBC in an interview. 

Kuhlmann said the feature will likely cause an increase in visits to health care providers, which could ultimately reduce costs for U.S. the health-care system overall. Ideally, if patients catch sleep apnea earlier, they can avoid paying for treatments for more serious conditions down the line.

“By finding out that they have these underlying sleep disorders and getting them treated, it could potentially actually help save expenses and help improve quality of life.”

How it works 

Apple’s sleep apnea detection feature works by analyzing a new metric that the company calls “breathing disturbances.” The Apple Watch identifies breathing disturbances by using an accelerometer to measure movements at the wrist that indicate disruptions to normal breathing patterns. 

Users can view their nightly metrics in the Health app, where they’ll be classified as either “elevated” or “not elevated,” i.e., normal. Apple will analyze this breathing disturbance data once a month and notify people if they show “consistent signs” of severe or moderate sleep apnea. Users can view their data over a one-month, six-month or one-year period. 

The Apple Watch Series 10 supports an 18-hour battery life, so people who are interested in using this feature will likely need to charge their device during the day.

Apple can also generate a report that users can bring to their doctors to discuss next steps. The report includes three months’ worth of breathing disturbance data as well as some additional information, the company said. Users can access educational materials within the Health app as well. 

Apple said the notification algorithm was developed with “an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,” and that the feature was validated in a clinical study.

“Now I’m jonesing to get an Apple [Watch] so I can try it out on myself,” Kuhlmann said.

* **Going over many reddit posts and youtube videos, it is recommend to have almost 100% invested into the equity and 5% to the bond or maybe not all to the bond. And what is your opinion about not putting money at all into the International equity fund? Feeling like I am answering my own questions haha.**
* **Last but not least, should I keep Alight managing this allocation or start managing it myself to avoid the fees?**

Office REITs- opportunity of the century?,"There's a saying, ""Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy"", and it's very clear that the market is very fearful of offices right now, but very greedy with the broader market(especially AI). Many office REITs are trading for pennies on the dollar, at 1-2X their annual cash flows, meanwhile the S&P500 P/E ratio is about 30.

While the pandemic did temporarily reduce office demand due to work from home, most organizations are forcing employees back to the office at least part time.

As a result of the work from home trend, construction of new offices has stalled, and some offices have been converted to other uses such as mixed use/residential. So supply of offices is stagnating, while demand is stabilizing. The only reason vacancy is growing is because tenants with 5-10 year leases are not renewing based on decreases in utilization that happened in 2020. But as the last of these leases signed pre-2020 expire, vacancies should stop increasing.

The crazy think is office rents don't even have to climb to make a ton of money on this. You can literally just buy a REIT with a 50% FFO yield, and it pays for itself in 2 years.

The main key is to find REITs that are trading at a low Price/FFO, and that have low amounts of debt. Then calculate how much their revenues would need to decline for the investment to fail.

The math is quite staggering, a lot of these REITs appear to be priced on the assumption that they will lose 70-80% of their tenants within the next 5 years, will be unable to find new ones, won't be able to sell the property, and that interest rates will remain elevated. I just don't see that being likely unless we have a great-depression level economic event, or another major shift in workplace culture where WFH becomes the standard again.",33,59,1726500990.0
Boeing freezes hiring in sweeping cost cuts as it grapples with factory worker strike,"Boeing announced sweeping cost cuts including a hiring freeze and a pause on nonessential staff travel to preserve cash as it deals with a strike of more than 30,000 factory workers..

Boeing factory workers, mostly in the Seattle area, started walking off the job early Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal and to strike.

“We are working in good faith to reach a new contract agreement that reflects their feedback and enables operations to resume,” CFO Brian West said in a staff note on Monday. ” However, our business is in a difficult period. This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future.”

The financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts but Boeing is focused on conserving cash, West said at a Morgan Stanley conference Friday. He said the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, wants to get back to the bargaining table right away to reach a new deal.

On Friday, Moody’s put all of Boeing’s credit ratings on review for a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said a prolonged strike could put Boeing at risk of a downgrade. That could drive up the borrowing costs of a manufacturer that already has mounting debt.

Boeing burned about $8 billion in the first half of the year as production slowed in the wake of a near-catastrophic door-panel blowout at the start of the year.

> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

> **Trump Media & Technology** — Shares rose more than 1%, extending the 11% gain from Friday. The stock jumped by as much as 25% in the previous session after Republican nominee and majority owner Donald Trump said he’s “not selling” his stake at a press conference at his California golf club Friday afternoon. Following his comments, trading was halted twice during that session due to volatility.

"It’s a big week for central banks around the world, with a slew of rate moves on the table","Nine months ago (i.e. December 2023), we were told that Fed was going to cut interest rates by 0.75% throughout 2024 while the market had once priced in more than 1.50% rate cut this year ...

As of today, no interest rate cut has been observed so far \~

*A flurry of major central banks will hold monetary policy meetings this week, with investors bracing for interest rate moves in either direction.*

*The Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated two-day meeting, which gets underway on Tuesday, is poised to take center stage.*

*The U.S. central bank is widely expected to join others around the world in starting its own rate-cutting cycle. The only remaining question appears to be by how much the Fed will reduce rates.*

*Traders currently see a quarter-point cut as the most likely outcome, although as many as 41% anticipate a half-point move, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool.*

*Elsewhere, Brazil’s central bank is scheduled to hold its next policy meeting across Tuesday and Wednesday. The Bank of England, Norway’s Norges Bank and South Africa’s Reserve Bank will all follow on Thursday.*

*A busy week of central bank meetings will be rounded off when the Bank of Japan delivers its latest rate decision at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Friday.*

*“We’re entering a cutting phase,” John Bilton, global head of multi-asset strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.*

*Speaking ahead of the European Central Bank’s most recent quarter-point rate cut, Bilton said the Fed was also set to cut interest rates by 25 basis points this week, with the Bank of England “likely getting in on the party” after the U.K. economy stagnated for a second consecutive month in July.*

*“We have all the ingredients for the beginning of a fairly extended cutting cycle but one that is probably not associated with a recession — and that’s an unusual set-up,” Bilton told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”*

*“It means that we get a lot of volatility to my mind in terms of price discovery around those who believe that actually the Fed \[is\] late, the ECB \[is\] late, this is a recession and those, like me, that believe that we don’t have the imbalances in the economy, and this will actually spur further upside.”*",177,46,1726485120.0

Nordstrom JWN,"We’re closing in on two weeks since it was unveiled that the Nordstrom family and the Mexican department store chain Liverpool made a bid for JWN at $23/share. 
When the bid was unveiled the price of the stock was the same as the bidding price, $23. However, it’s been close to half a year since it was announced that a special committee would be made to consider a buyout offer from the family and at that time the price of the stock was $17. So, $23 actually means a 35 % premium compared to March 2024 when it was announced a buyout offer would come - but now that we have the offer six months later, it may be to the family’s own misfortune that the price has gained 35 % making the offer perhaps seem like lowballing. But, did the price actually only go up because investors knew a buyout offer was underway? No one knows but Nordstrom has outperformed peers in recent quarters and delivered on earnings when peers haven’t. Furthermore, during these six months inflation has gone down and a rate cut is imminent indicating smoother sailing for retail. 

Today, two weeks after the bid was unveiled, the price seems anchored around $23. The Board needs to approve the bid for any sale to be completed. Macy’s and Kohl’s have also received bids in recent times but in both cases there have been significant premiums ranging from 30-40 %. Both companies declined despite these premiums. Nordstrom is a little different seeing as the family owns a big part of the company. However, the Board is perfectly capable of declining offers from the family as became clear just 8 years ago when the board declined an offer from the family for $50/share. 

Opinions and ideas on what’s going to happen to JWN in the days, weeks, months and years to come? Will the Board accept $23? If not, what will that do to the price of the stock? Will it crash or be unaffected? ",9,6,1726470952.0

* $2B aid money for a new chip plant in Poland
* $3.5B military contract
* NVDA and Apple kindly 'nudged' to use Intel foundaries (instead of TSMC). This will be fun!

A lot of it seems like a government bailout, because chips are soooo strategic, critical, etc. That's what you get when people who think ""*files are in the cloud, up above*"" in literal sense, have too much legislative powers. But that's good news for a dinosaur company at least in the short term.

Besides, the company is exploring strategic options like selling parts of its business and scrapping some projects. The stock's price has already declined significantly since Intel reported its latest earnings in August, and it's one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks of the year. Yet, it's holding onto its place in the blue-chip Dow Jones index. The company is also exploring potential partnerships and acquisitions to strengthen its business.

","Say you have a budget of $1000. You buy $100 SPY/QQQ calls every day. Most will go to 0 but if the move is towards the upside (and stocks/options tend to convex to the upside) you would see a huge gain.

The math comes to you needing a 10x move at least 1/10 times to break even.

What do you think?

**UPDATE**

I never said this was some genius strategy but a lot of these comments are truly dumb.

1. there is no theta. It's 0dte.
2. there is no assignment. you are buying the call
3. there is no tits up/ lose it all scenario...since you only lose that one small bet at any given time.
4. strike price blah blah doesnt matter since you are betting on direction - however i guess it ideally has to be close to in the money for it to actually have a chance to make a big jump

$DJT (Not political) Just thoughts and an expectation of a super interesting stock ,"[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-not-selling-his-shares-truth-social-company-2024-09-13/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-not-selling-his-shares-truth-social-company-2024-09-13/)

* **The major holder of $DJT said:  I will not sell. This being Trump, those that own the stock should think about the scenarios** 
   1. Trump will SELL (all or a very large portion) a week or so before the election, as he knows his company has little to zero value, especially if he loses.
   2. Trump is a man of his word, he will not sell 

* **Trump wins**
   * This stock will see 40$ - 80$ overnight. If he has sold, nobody will care. 
* **Trump loses**
   * His fans will lose fortunes.  There will be no consequence for Trump as this is his last political hurrah. 



* **Thoughts to consider**
   1. Would Trump pass on 1 billion (or more) if he knows that a negative election result will send the stock below 10$, or more likely below 5$ ? 
   2. Would Trump take the risk in a 50/50 win chance scenario of losing billions?  Or would he do as traders do?  Secure profits. 
   3. Trump is a businessman, he  does not do Charity (if anything his family/org is convicted of stealing from Cancer Kids Charity).  So, will he care about his fans/supporters?  

My theory is that the stock will rise into election day, if the polls are indicating a tight race or a lead.  A good entry point would be, I guess 15$.  Trade up to 25$ (or so) and take the investment out. Let the rest run, and sell at 46 (as a hommage to Biden). 

Your thoughts?

Apple the new healthtech giant?,"
This week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.

Yet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.

Does anyone see what I am seeing, or am I missing something here?

Mathematically speaking is there a way to find an infinite money glitch if you have access to purchase both an asset and the short of that a,"Say you have an asset like stock ""A"" and that stock ""A"" is currently $10 a share. Within a brokerage you can buy many of stock ""A"". There is also a short of stock ""A"" that goes up 2X as fast as stock ""A"" goes down. When stock ""A"" has a bad day you would want to hold this short. For simplicity we will call the short of stock ""A"" as ABC stock.

My friend and I are both math nerds but would like to know if there is truly an infinite money glitch if you have access to both the stock and short of the stock? Does the short of the stock being 2X affect anything more or less than if the short was only going up exactly in line (1X) of the price of the stock?

More specifically as some of you are probably aware you can put in limit orders to buy a stock only if the stock price drops to being at or below a certain price. You also could buy using a trailing stop loss, so if and only iff the stock price drops 3% from the current or future price it will trigger a buy order.

Came across a formula that obviously was not totally accurate but maybe with some changes it could be either at or near a money glitch to always make money, granted you would need to go in every few days and put in the orders once the buy and/or sale happens. Mind you this assumes a person has +$25k in their account to do unlimited day trades.",0,52,1726365237.0
Why Is the S&P 500 so Bullish?,"Hey everyone,

I've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?




The Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.




Wall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.




Youth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price



Now obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.


Why do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?

Are strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?

Are there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?

Is the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?

NVDA Bear Case | AI Bubble Collapse | Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis | Thematics,"# Background

 The AI scaling hypothesis is a key concept in artificial intelligence research that suggests improvements in AI capabilities can be achieved primarily by increasing the size and computational resources of AI models. We can understand several aspects of this hypothesis:

Key Points of the AI Scaling Hypothesis

1. **Emergence of Capabilities**: As AI models grow larger and are trained on more data, they tend to develop new capabilities that were not explicitly programmed. This emergence of novel abilities is a central tenet of the scaling hypothesis.
2. **Generalization**: Larger models demonstrate improved ability to generalize across different tasks and domains, often showing surprising competence in areas they were not specifically trained for.
3. **Efficiency in Learning**: Scaled-up models can learn more efficiently from limited data, sometimes matching or surpassing the performance of smaller, task-specific models with just a few examples.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The hypothesis suggests that continuing to scale up models will lead to further improvements in AI performance and capabilities, potentially approaching or even surpassing human-level abilities in various domains.

# Hyperscalers and First Mover Advantage

The scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in AI, including large language models and multimodal AI systems. However, it's important to note that while scaling has proven effective, it also comes with challenges such as increased computational requirements and potential biases in large datasets.

Hyperscalers are racing to scale their AI capabilities and be ***the first to discover emergent properties for several compelling reasons at any cost. This is the main driver in the billions of capital expenditures over the last 18 months.*** At the forefront is the significant competitive advantage that comes with pioneering new AI capabilities in the fast-evolving tech landscape. Being first allows these companies to establish market dominance, attract and retain customers seeking cutting-edge AI solutions, and gain valuable insights from early deployments. This advantage is not merely about prestige; it translates directly into substantial economic benefits.

The economic incentives driving this race are staggering. Industry projections suggest that AI technology in data centers alone could drive spending of up to $2 trillion over the next five years. Additionally, the AI silicon market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2027. These figures underscore the massive financial opportunity that awaits those who lead in AI capabilities. Hyperscalers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing demand for custom AI silicon and infrastructure, potentially securing a significant share of this burgeoning market.

The rush to scale is also fueled by the promise of technological breakthroughs. ***The AI scaling hypothesis suggests that continued increases in model size and computational resources will lead to the emergence of novel capabilities not explicitly programmed, improved generalization across different tasks and domains, and more efficient learning from limited data***\*.\* This potential for transformative advancements keeps hyperscalers intensely focused on pushing the boundaries of AI scale.

Hyperscalers are uniquely positioned in this race due to their existing infrastructure advantages. They possess the necessary computational resources, data centers, and cloud infrastructure that can be leveraged for AI training and deployment. This allows them to offer scalable AI services to a wide range of customers, from individuals to large enterprises, further cementing their market position.

Strategically, leading in AI capabilities allows hyperscalers to shape the future direction of AI development and applications, influence industry standards, and attract top AI talent and research partnerships. The potential for breakthrough discoveries, including the possibility of approaching or surpassing human-level abilities in various domains or even developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), adds another layer of motivation to their efforts.

# Falsifying the Scalability Hypothesis

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind many recent advancements in artificial intelligence, but there are compelling arguments for how it could potentially be falsified

One primary method would be ***to demonstrate diminishing returns as models are scaled up in size and computational resources.*** ***If performance gains plateau or even decline rather than continuing to improve linearly or superlinearly, it would suggest fundamental limits to scaling***. This could be coupled with identifying qualitative gaps – cognitive abilities or tasks that larger models consistently fail at, even as they improve on other benchmarks. Such findings would indicate that some fundamental capabilities are missing and cannot be addressed by pure scaling alone.

# Simple Bench

Simple bench is the only reasoning benchmark written in natural language at which English-speaking humans (and yes, even 'smart highschoolers') can score 90%+, while frontier LLMs get less than 50%. It is an encapsulation of the reasoning deficit found in AI like ChatGPT.

 What the benchmark does is take a standard kind of logic puzzle that people ask LLM's, then spikes it with a ""surprise twist"" that requires what we would think of as common sense.  Thus an AI has more difficulty in predicting the next tokens because of the twist.  But humans can still reason out an answer.

These questions are fully private, preventing contamination, and have been vetted by PhDs from multiple domains, as well as the author - Philip, from AI Explained - who first exposed the numerous errors in the MMLU (Aug 2023). \[https://simple-bench.com/about.html\]

|GPT-4o|Not publicly disclosed|
|Claude|Not publicly disclosed|
|||

***These large AI companies don’t disclose training parameter sizes because we can graph training size vs benchmark score to falsify the scalability hypothesis.***

The AI scaling hypothesis has been a driving force behind significant advancements in artificial intelligence, propelling the development of increasingly powerful models and fueling a race among hyperscalers to achieve breakthrough capabilities. This hypothesis has led to remarkable improvements in AI performance across various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and beyond.

However, as we delve deeper into the realm of large-scale AI models, we are beginning to encounter signs that suggest the scaling hypothesis may have limitations. The emergence of benchmarks like Simple Bench, which reveal persistent reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, indicates that simply increasing model size and computational resources may not be sufficient to achieve human-level reasoning capabilities.

The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models adds another layer of intrigue to this discussion. ***This lack of transparency makes it challenging for the broader scientific community to accurately assess the relationship between model scale and performance, potentially hindering efforts to validate or falsify the scaling hypothesis.***

Moreover, the increasing costs associated with training and deploying ever-larger models, coupled with concerns about data scarcity and computational limitations, raise questions about the long-term sustainability of the scaling approach. As we approach these practical and theoretical limits, it becomes clear that the future of AI advancement may require more than just scaling up existing architectures.

Looking ahead, the field of AI research may need to pivot towards more innovative approaches that focus on qualitative improvements in model architecture, training methodologies, and data utilization. The development of more sophisticated benchmarks, like Simple Bench, that can effectively measure complex reasoning abilities will be crucial in guiding these efforts.

Ultimately, while the scaling hypothesis has undoubtedly driven remarkable progress in AI, its limitations are becoming increasingly apparent. The next frontier in AI research may lie not in building ever-larger models, but in developing more efficient, adaptable, and truly intelligent systems that can match or exceed human-level reasoning across a wide range of tasks. This shift could lead to a new paradigm in AI development, one that combines the insights gained from scaling with novel approaches to create more capable and robust artificial intelligence.

# AI Bubble Collapse and Trillions in Misallocated Capital

 The AI scaling hypothesis has been the cornerstone of recent advancements in artificial intelligence, driving unprecedented investments and fueling a race among tech giants to build ever-larger models. However, as we stand on the precipice of a potential paradigm shift, the falsification of this hypothesis could trigger a seismic disruption in the AI industry, potentially leading to the collapse of what many now recognize as an AI bubble.

The signs of this impending crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Benchmarks like Simple Bench are exposing critical reasoning deficits in even the most advanced language models, defying the expectation that larger models inherently lead to more intelligent systems. The reluctance of major AI companies to disclose training parameter sizes for their latest models further fuels suspicion that the relationship between scale and performance may not be as straightforward as once believed.

 As the evidence mounts against the scaling hypothesis, we must confront the sobering reality of the potential misallocation of trillions of dollars in capital. Hyperscalers and investors have poured vast resources into the development of massive data centers, custom AI chips, and enormous models, all predicated on the belief that bigger is inherently better. If this foundational assumption proves false, the repercussions will be far-reaching and profound.

The collapse of the AI bubble, triggered by the falsification of the scaling hypothesis, could lead to:

1.  A dramatic reassessment of the valuations of AI-focused companies, potentially wiping out billions in market capitalization.

2.  A crisis of confidence in the AI industry, leading to a sharp decline in investment and a potential ""AI winter.""

**This potential collapse serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of putting too much faith in a single hypothesis**, no matter how compelling it may seem. It underscores the critical importance of diverse approaches in AI research and the need for rigorous, independent verification of claims made by industry leaders.

"Verizon puts price tag on buyouts and says nearly 5,000 employees are leaving","Verizon Communications Inc. said Thursday it expects charges of up to $1.9 billion in its third quarter in connection with employee buyouts.

About 4,800 employees will leave the telecommunications giant by March under the voluntary separation program that Verizon announced in June. Half of those employees are leaving in September, the company said.

Verizon said that it expects to record severance charges in a range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, or $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in after-tax charges, in the third quarter.

In a filing in February, Verizon said it had about 105,400 full-time employees as of December, with 89% of them based in the U.S.

Verizon also said that as part of ongoing cost-savings initiatives, it plans to stop using certain offices and leave “non-strategic portions” of certain businesses, without giving more details.

As a result, it also expects to record asset and business rationalization charges in the range of $230 million to $380 million, or $170 million to $290 million after tax, in the quarter.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect Verizon to report in mid-October adjusted earnings of $1.18 a share on sales of $33.7 billion for its third quarter.

In the third quarter of 2023, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 on sales of $33.3 billion.

Verizon earlier this month announced plans to buy Frontier Communications Parent Inc. in a $20 billion all-cash deal, a play for a fiber-internet provider in the U.S.

Verizon shares have gained more than 15% this year, slightly underperforming an advance of around 16% for the S&P 500

"If your the type of investor who mainly invests in companies that benefits your life, do you invest in RDDT?","For example my cousin is a big Apple person (Iphone, Apple Watch, Apple TV etc) and is a shopaholic at Ulta. So she purchases stocks of these companies.  She says she doesn't care about the stock performance that much - as these companies provide her with value and satisfaction in her life. 

In a way, like trying to recover the cost for the several Iphones she has bought since the start. 

But when I asked her about Reddit... something she uses, she is iffy about purchasing the stock.  Her reasoning is, its offerings is not tangible.. so she is not sure how the company really makes money.  Even with ads propping up, she isn't sold ... for now.

I personally have bought some RDDT stocks because I use it often and feel like I owe it back if that makes sense.

Ok question for those that have the mindset more like my cousin or in general don't see a pathway to solid profitability.

Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year',"Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said — in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030. According to the report, published on Sept. 9, the kingdom's $925 billion Public Investment Fund will lead the investment.

Altimmune or Viking? The Obesity hype. $VKTX vs $ALT,"The Obesity Hype. A real hype that can blow portfolios more so than AI, look at the Viking stock trajectory. To figure out the science, is hard.

I am not saying buy this stock. I am saying, verify the below comparison with somebody. If the below is correct. You did your DD.

1. **Why $ALT over $VKTX?**
   * VKTX-2735 < PEMVI 2.4mg -- PEMVI superior quality of Weight Loss as measured by % FAT vs. % LEAN reduction (i.e. the KEY next-gen GLP1 metric)
   * PEMVI broad CARDIOVASCULAR activity/potential
   * PEMVI MOA includes Thermogenic/RMR component for LT use
   * PEMVI body recomp. potential via class-leading lean muscle preservation
   * PEMVI P3 titration/DR design to 'fix' outlier 48wk P2 (other PEMVI studies have shown tolerability on par with VK2735)
   * VK2735 is faster WL which is better for BMI 40+ class 3 Obesity (smaller market), but not for avg. person -- VK to compete with $LLY Zep,
   * PEMVI is SIGNIFICANTLY differentiated high quality Next-gen GLP1 WL
   * VKTX-2809 < PEMVI 1.8mg -- PEMVI rapid liver defatting in 6-12 wks (MASLD)
   * PEMVI better 24wk anti-fibrotic potential vs 52wk VKTX
   * PEMVI bypasses thyroid and is leading GLP1 liver MOA
2. **Why is Viking valued at 50$ and Altimmune at 6$?**
   * Viking Management simply is better at managing their stock. Viking has 900 million in cash, which they simply raised in a brilliant way.
   * Altimmune had some set-backs in the past, which may make WS suspicious.
   * Altimmune had a short report to endure, in which Kerrisdale stupidly rehashed old data, BUT Altimmune management FAILED at protecting the stock they let Jefferies do their bidding, plus their cash runway is not convincing. Their only response was a meaningless Tweet.
   * Altimmune cash runway 150 million (or so), they stupidly ran the ATM at the absolute wrong moment.
   * Altimmune is stupidly promising a partner for over a year now, and have not delivered.
3. **But why is Altimmune still the better stock?**
   * Pemvi as explained above, is smarter. Not Obesity, but curative fatty liver - COVERED BY INSURANCE ALREADY. Which pure obesity drugs are not, like Zepbound Wegovy
   * Altimmune has FAST TRACK status. A nugget overseen by many
   * Altimmune has a much much larger upside, at this moment. The odds of Viking crashing, extremely high. They are a Bio, they will face a setback. I believe if Viking was to be bought now, it would be at 100$ per share
   * If Altimmune was to be bought now, 40$-75$ per share would be fair.
   * If Altimmune announces a partner, it will likely be a 20$ 30$ stock within days.",12,20,1726241365.0
Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-sharing trips in Austin and Atlanta ,"Uber announced Friday it is expanding its partnership with Alphabet’s Waymo to offer robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta beginning in early 2025. Shares of Uber jumped 5% on the news while Alphabet rose about 1%.

Uber riders in those cities can be matched with a driverless Waymo car for some trips, according to the companies. The rides will only be available through Uber’s app, unlike in San Francisco and Los Angeles where riders book through the Waymo app. A Waymo spokesperson said it had no plans to partner with Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The expansion comes as Uber faces investor pressure to step up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s planned robotaxi event slated for Oct. 10. Shares of Uber have fallen 9% since the Tesla event was announced and are off 17% from their 52-week highs. 

It may also slow Waymo encroachment into Uber’s market share. An analysis from Bernstein estimated that, as of May 2024, Waymo’s 50,000 weekly paid rides made up approximately 2% of ride-sharing usage in San Francisco. Since then, Waymo has doubled its paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 a week, the company announced. 

“We’re thrilled to build on our successful partnership with Waymo, which has already powered fully autonomous trips for tens of thousands of riders in Phoenix,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. 

Uber’s initial agreement with Waymo in Phoenix also included autonomous Uber Eats deliveries in the city. The expansion into Austin and Atlanta won’t include Uber Eats at first, according to the Waymo spokesperson, but they’re exploring that possibility for the future. 

Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said, “We’ve been delighted at the positive feedback from our Waymo One riders to date, and we can’t wait to bring the comfort, convenience, and safety of the Waymo Driver to these cities in partnership with Uber.” 

The expansion into two more cities is another step in Uber’s advancement into the robotaxi space, after struggling to get a foothold and selling off its own self-driving division in 2020, now relying on partnerships with companies including Waymo, GM’s Cruise and the SoftBank-backed U.K. startup Wayve to gain ground. 

Uber shares dipped in August after the company announced a multiyear partnership with Cruise to offer autonomous rides through its app next year. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski cited Cruise’s previous safety challenges as a part of the investor skepticism, along with now-fulfilled hopes for a partnership with Waymo instead. 

Waymo has rapidly made strides in the self-driving race. It currently offers robotaxi services to the public in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It has logged more than 22 million miles through June of this year, and last week, it released a report that argued its vehicles are safer than human drivers. It began testing driverless cars on Bay Area freeways with Google employees in August.

Some analysts were more hopeful for a potential Uber and Waymo expansion into San Francisco. But Atlanta and Austin, where Waymo has already begun testing, may still help sentiment.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

- They also have a ratio of 8:1 in terms of total current assets to total current liabilities. Meaning they can payoff their short term debt 8x. This is good news. 
Id also like to add an investment piece they have “We have excluded the impact of the Shopify investment option of 15,743,174 shares at $88.93 per share as it was out of the money as of June 30, 2024. The investment option expires on July 28, 2030.”

They have a phat relationship with Shopify and are expecting to grow with them and capitalize on their company growth.

All of this can be found on their earnings report: https://investors.klaviyo.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx

**Price Targets**

Needham: $40 (9/4/24)
Barclays: Overweight ($32) (8/8/24)
Keyblanc: ($33) (8/8/24)

**Financial Outlook**
Revenue: Q3 (225M) -> Q4 (910M)
Non-GAAP: Q3 (21.5M) -> Q4 (103M)


Their spending on R&D and G&A were both down by 100+ basis points on their recent earnings report. As they increased their spending on Sales and Marketing which they already stated would be happening in the previous quarters. 

TLDR: KVYO good deals, solid growth projections, great leadership/board, entry price slightly higher than IPO price, starting to dominate its industry and acquiring customers from Mailchimp. 

This is *just* DD I have no positions currently, but I *AM* looking to acquire shares, and most likely calls for the next earnings in November. ",9,17,1726182985.0

Large option activity at close - signal bearish/ bullish signal? ,"I follow stocks and often watch the option activity online

A few weeks ago, I was watching LRCX when it dropped from $870 to $820. After the drop, I noticed that end of day there was a large number of put options bought that then brought LRCX down to $800 and even further to $715 range the following weeks

I noticed today that someone bought a large number of call options at last 15 min of close for NXST. I am going to watch as they have dropped in price the past week with rest of market somewhat rebounding. 

When large option positions are bought, it tends to drive the price up for the short period. However, both the above mentioned stocks have low volume. Does that implicate that they are being used as leverage for potential market price swings in a broader market? ",0,4,1726177512.0
